Let me break down this problem:

1. We have a 2D list (jagged array - rows can have different lengths)
2. We need to find all occurrences of integer `x`
3. Return coordinates as (row, column) tuples
4. Sort primarily by row (ascending)
5. Within each row, sort by column (descending)

Let me trace through the first example:
- `x = 1`
- Row 0: [1,2,3,4,5,6] - 1 is at index 0 → (0, 0)
- Row 1: [1,2,3,4,1,6] - 1 is at indices 0 and 4 → (1, 0) and (1, 4)
- Row 2: [1,2,3,4,5,1] - 1 is at indices 0 and 5 → (2, 0) and (2, 5)

After sorting by row (ascending) then by column within each row (descending):
- Row 0: (0, 0)
- Row 1: (1, 4), (1, 0) - columns sorted descending: 4 > 0
- Row 2: (2, 5), (2, 0) - columns sorted descending: 5 > 0

Result: [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)] ✓

Algorithm:
1. Iterate through each row with its index
2. For each row, iterate through each column with its index
3. When we find `x`, add (row, col) to results
4. Sort by row ascending (primary), then by column descending (secondary)

```python
def get_row(lst, x):
    coordinates = []
    
    # Find all occurrences of x
    for row_idx, row in enumerate(lst):
        for col_idx, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == x:
                coordinates.append((row_idx, col_idx))
    
    # Sort by row ascending, then by column descending within each row
    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    
    return coordinates
```
