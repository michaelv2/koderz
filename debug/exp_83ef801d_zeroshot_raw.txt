To solve this problem, we need to calculate the strength of each extension based on the number of uppercase and lowercase letters it contains. The strength is defined as the difference between the count of uppercase letters (CAP) and the count of lowercase letters (SM). We then need to find the extension with the highest strength. If there are multiple extensions with the same strength, we choose the one that appears first in the list.

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement this:

1. Define a function `Strongest_Extension` that takes two parameters: `class_name` and `extensions`.
2. Initialize variables to keep track of the strongest extension and its strength.
3. Iterate through each extension, calculate its strength, and compare it with the current strongest extension.
4. If a stronger extension is found, update the strongest extension and its strength.
5. Return the formatted string combining the class name and the strongest extension.

```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest_extension = ''
    max_strength = float('-inf')
    
    for extension in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for char in extension if char.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for char in extension if char.islower())
        strength = cap - sm
        
        if strength > max_strength:
            max_strength = strength
            strongest_extension = extension
    
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest_extension}'
```

This function calculates the strength of each extension and keeps track of the strongest one. Finally, it returns the formatted string with the class name and the strongest extension.
