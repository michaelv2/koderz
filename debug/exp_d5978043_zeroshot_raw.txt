Let me break down the problem:

1. Accept a list of strings
2. Delete strings with odd lengths (keep only even-length strings)
3. Sort the remaining strings by:
   - Primary: ascending by length
   - Secondary: alphabetically (for same-length words)
4. Return the sorted list

Let me trace through the examples:
- `["aa", "a", "aaa"]`: 
  - "aa" has length 2 (even) ✓
  - "a" has length 1 (odd) ✗
  - "aaa" has length 3 (odd) ✗
  - Result: `["aa"]`

- `["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]`:
  - "ab" has length 2 (even) ✓
  - "a" has length 1 (odd) ✗
  - "aaa" has length 3 (odd) ✗
  - "cd" has length 2 (even) ✓
  - After filtering: `["ab", "cd"]`
  - Both have length 2, sort alphabetically: `["ab", "cd"]`

```python
def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    # Filter strings with even lengths only
    even_length_strings = [s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 == 0]
    
    # Sort by length first, then alphabetically
    sorted_result = sorted(even_length_strings, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))
    
    return sorted_result
```
