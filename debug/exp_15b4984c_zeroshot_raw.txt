The function computes the sum of absolute values and multiplies by the product of signs: if any element is zero the result is 0; if the array is empty it returns None; otherwise the sign is -1 if there are an odd number of negatives, else 1.

```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    """
    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return
    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs
    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.
    Note: return None for empty arr.

    if not arr:
        return None
    total = 0
    neg_count = 0
    for x in arr:
        if x == 0:
            return 0
        if x < 0:
            neg_count += 1
        total += abs(x)
    sign = -1 if (neg_count % 2 == 1) else 1
