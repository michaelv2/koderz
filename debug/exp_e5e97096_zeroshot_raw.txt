To determine if a list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, we can check the relationship between consecutive elements. If all pairs of consecutive elements are either non-decreasing or non-increasing, the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

Here's the function implementation:

```python
def monotonic(l: list) -> bool:
    if not l:
        return True  # An empty list is considered monotonically increasing/decreasing
    
    increasing = decreasing = True
    
    for i in range(1, len(l)):
        if l[i] > l[i - 1]:
            decreasing = False
        elif l[i] < l[i - 1]:
            increasing = False
    
    return increasing or decreasing
```

This function initializes two flags, `increasing` and `decreasing`, to `True`. It then iterates through the list starting from the second element. For each pair of consecutive elements, it updates the flags accordingly. If any pair violates the increasing or decreasing condition, the corresponding flag is set to `False`. Finally, the function returns `True` if either flag remains `True`, indicating that the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.
