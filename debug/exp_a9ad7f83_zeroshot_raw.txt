To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Iterate through each word in the list.
2. For each word, determine the number of unique characters.
3. Keep track of the word with the maximum number of unique characters.
4. If there are multiple words with the same number of unique characters, choose the one that comes first lexicographically.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def find_max(words):
    max_word = ""
    max_unique_chars = 0
    
    for word in words:
        unique_chars = len(set(word))
        if unique_chars > max_unique_chars or (unique_chars == max_unique_chars and word < max_word):
            max_word = word
            max_unique_chars = unique_chars
    
    return max_word
```
