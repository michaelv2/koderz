To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each row of the given nested list and find all occurrences of the integer `x`. For each occurrence, we record its coordinates as a tuple `(row, column)`. After collecting all coordinates, we sort them first by row in ascending order and then by column in descending order within each row.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the coordinates.
2. Iterate through each row of the nested list using `enumerate` to get both the index (row) and the row itself.
3. For each row, iterate through its elements using `enumerate` to get both the index (column) and the element itself.
4. If the element matches `x`, append the tuple `(row, column)` to the coordinates list.
5. Sort the coordinates list first by row in ascending order and then by column in descending order within each row.

```python
def get_row(lst, x):
    coordinates = []
    
    for i, row in enumerate(lst):
        for j, element in enumerate(row):
            if element == x:
                coordinates.append((i, j))
    
    # Sort coordinates by row ascending and then by column descending
    sorted_coordinates = sorted(coordinates, key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    
    return sorted_coordinates
```
