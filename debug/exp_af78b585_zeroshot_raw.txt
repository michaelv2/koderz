 I will write a Python function that takes a string representing a sentence as input and returns a new string containing the words from the original sentence whose lengths are prime numbers. The order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.

To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:
1. Split the sentence into individual words.
2. Iterate over each word and check if its length is a prime number.
3. If the length is prime, add the word to the new string.
4. Join the selected words with spaces and return the new string.

Here's the Python code that implements this solution:

```python
def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    words = sentence.split()
    prime_words = []
    for word in words:
        if is_prime(len(word)):
            prime_words.append(word)
    return ' '.join(prime_words)
```
