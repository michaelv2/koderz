To solve this problem, we need to determine if there is a way to concatenate two given strings of parentheses such that the resulting string is balanced. A string of parentheses is balanced if every opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')' and they are correctly nested.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Calculate the balance of each string individually. The balance is defined as the number of unmatched opening parentheses after processing the string from left to right.
2. For each string, also calculate the minimum balance encountered during this process. This helps in understanding if at any point the string has more closing parentheses than opening ones.
3. Try concatenating the strings in both possible orders and check if the resulting balance is zero and the minimum balance never goes negative.

Let's implement this logic in the function `match_parens`.

```python
def match_parens(lst):
    def calculate_balance(s):
        balance = 0
        min_balance = 0
        for char in s:
            if char == '(':
                balance += 1
            else:
                balance -= 1
            min_balance = min(min_balance, balance)
        return balance, min_balance

    s1, s2 = lst
    balance1, min_balance1 = calculate_balance(s1)
    balance2, min_balance2 = calculate_balance(s2)

    # Check s1 + s2
    if balance1 + min_balance2 >= 0 and balance1 + balance2 == 0:
        return 'Yes'
    
    # Check s2 + s1
    if balance2 + min_balance1 >= 0 and balance2 + balance1 == 0:
        return 'Yes'
    
    return 'No'
```
