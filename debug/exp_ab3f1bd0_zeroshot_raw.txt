```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        # Convert the number to positive and convert it into string
        str_num = str(abs(num))
        
        # Check if the first and last digits are odd
        if int(str_num[0]) % 2 != 0 and int(str_num[-1]) % 2 != 0:
            count += 1
    return count
```
This function works by iterating over each number in the input list. For each number, it converts the absolute value of the number to a string so that we can access its first and last digits. It then checks if both these digits are odd (i.e., their remainders when divided by 2 are not zero). If they are, it increments a counter. Finally, it returns this count.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list because we iterate over each element once. The space complexity is also O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space to store our count and temporary variables.
