To solve this problem, we need to implement a function `strlen` that returns the length of a given string. In Python, the built-in `len()` function can be used to determine the number of characters in a string. This is the most straightforward and efficient way to achieve the desired functionality.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. Define the function `strlen` with one parameter `string` which is expected to be of type `str`.
2. Use the built-in `len()` function to calculate the length of the input string.
3. Return the result from the `len()` function.

This approach leverages Python's built-in capabilities and ensures that the implementation is both simple and efficient.

```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string """
    return len(string)
```
