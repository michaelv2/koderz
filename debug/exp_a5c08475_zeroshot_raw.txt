```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import functools
import operator

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not numbers:  # If the list is empty
        return (0, 1)
    else:
        total_sum = sum(numbers)
        product = functools.reduce(operator.mul, numbers, 1)
        return (total_sum, product)
```

This function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a tuple of `0` and `1` as per the problem statement. Otherwise, it calculates the sum using Python's built-in `sum()` function and the product by using `functools.reduce()` with `operator.mul` to multiply all elements in the list together.
