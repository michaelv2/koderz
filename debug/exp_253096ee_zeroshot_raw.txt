```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]  # Convert to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    return "db" + binary + "db"  # Add the 'db' characters at both ends
```
This function works by first converting the decimal number to a binary string using Python's built-in `bin` function. This gives us a string that starts with '0b', so we remove these two characters using slicing (`[2:]`). Then, we add the 'db' characters at both ends of the binary string and return the result.
