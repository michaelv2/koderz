To solve this problem, we need to determine how many carrots the rabbit will have eaten after attempting to meet its nutritional needs and how many carrots will be left. The logic is straightforward:

1. Calculate the total number of carrots needed by adding the `number` already eaten to the `need`.
2. Compare the `remaining` carrots with the `need`. If there are enough remaining carrots, subtract the `need` from `remaining` to get the leftover carrots.
3. If there aren't enough remaining carrots, the rabbit will eat all of them, and we'll set the remaining count to zero.
4. The total number of eaten carrots will be the sum of the initially eaten carrots (`number`) and the actual number of carrots eaten from the remaining stock (which is either `need` or `remaining`, whichever is smaller).

Here's the implementation:

```python
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    if need <= remaining:
        return [number + need, remaining - need]
    else:
        return [number + remaining, 0]
```
