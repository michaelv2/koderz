To implement the `decode_shift` function, we need to reverse the operation performed by `encode_shift`. While `encode_shift` shifts each character 5 positions forward in the alphabet, `decode_shift` should shift each character 5 positions backward.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the `decode_shift` function:
1. For each character `c` in the input string `s`, determine its ASCII value using `ord(c)`.
2. Subtract 5 from this ASCII value to shift the character backward by 5 positions.
3. Use modulo 26 arithmetic to wrap around if necessary (i.e., if the result is less than 'a').
4. Convert the resulting ASCII value back to a character using `chr()`.
5. Join all the characters together to form the decoded string.

The formula for decoding a character `c` can be expressed as:
\[ \text{decoded\_char} = \text{chr}(((\text{ord}(c) - 5 - \text{ord}("a")) \% 26) + \text{ord}("a")) \]

This ensures that the character wraps around correctly from 'a' to 'z'.

Here is the implementation of both functions:

```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    """
    returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])


def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])
```
