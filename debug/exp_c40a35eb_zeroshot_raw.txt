To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Extract the first `k` elements from the array.
2. Filter out the elements that have more than two digits.
3. Sum the remaining elements.

Here's the Python function implementing this logic:

```python
def add_elements(arr, k):
    # Extract the first k elements
    first_k_elements = arr[:k]
    
    # Filter out elements with more than two digits
    filtered_elements = [x for x in first_k_elements if -99 <= x <= 99]
    
    # Sum the remaining elements
    return sum(filtered_elements)
```

This function first slices the array to get the first `k` elements. It then uses a list comprehension to filter out any elements that are not within the range of `-99` to `99`. Finally, it returns the sum of the filtered elements.
