Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Check if a number is the product of exactly 3 prime numbers
2. The number is less than 100
3. Return True if it is, False otherwise

Let me break this down:
- First, I need a way to check if a number is prime
- Then, I need to find all prime factors of the given number
- Finally, check if there are exactly 3 prime factors (counting multiplicities)

Let me trace through the example:
- 30 = 2 × 3 × 5
- All three are prime numbers
- So 30 should return True

```python
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n < 2:
            return False
        if n == 2:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return False
        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    # Find prime factors and count them
    prime_factors = []
    temp = a
    
    # Check for factor 2
    while temp % 2 == 0:
        prime_factors.append(2)
        temp //= 2
    
    # Check for odd factors from 3 onwards
    i = 3
    while i * i <= temp:
        while temp % i == 0:
            prime_factors.append(i)
            temp //= i
        i += 2
    
    # If temp is still greater than 1, then it's a prime factor
    if temp > 1:
        prime_factors.append(temp)
    
    # Check if we have exactly 3 prime factors
    return len(prime_factors) == 3
```
