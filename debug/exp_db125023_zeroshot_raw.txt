Looking at this problem, I need to create a function that returns all prefixes of a given string, from shortest to longest.

Let me think through the approach:
1. I need to iterate through the string from index 1 to the full length
2. For each position, I take a slice from the beginning up to that position
3. This will give me prefixes of increasing length

For example, with 'abc':
- Position 1: 'a' (string[0:1])
- Position 2: 'ab' (string[0:2])  
- Position 3: 'abc' (string[0:3])

```python
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    return [string[:i] for i in range(1, len(string) + 1)]
```
