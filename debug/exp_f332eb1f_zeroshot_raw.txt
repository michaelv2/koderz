To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Round each element in the list up to the nearest integer using the ceiling function.
2. Square each of the rounded numbers.
3. Sum all the squared numbers.

We can use Python's `math.ceil()` function to round up and a list comprehension to perform the operations on each element in the list.

Here is the complete function implementation:

```python
import math

def sum_squares(lst):
    return sum(math.ceil(x) ** 2 for x in lst)
```

This function uses a generator expression inside the `sum()` function to iterate over each element in the input list, round it up using `math.ceil()`, square it, and then sum all the squared values.
