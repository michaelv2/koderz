To solve this problem, we need to parse the input string and identify groups of balanced parentheses that are not nested within each other. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize Variables**: We'll use a list to store the resulting groups of parentheses and a counter to keep track of the balance of parentheses.

2. **Iterate Through the String**: We'll loop through each character in the string, ignoring spaces.

3. **Track Balance**: For each opening parenthesis `(`, we'll increment the balance counter. For each closing parenthesis `)`, we'll decrement it.

4. **Identify Groups**: When the balance counter returns to zero, it indicates that we've found a complete group of balanced parentheses. We'll then extract this substring and add it to our result list.

5. **Return Result**: After processing the entire string, we'll return the list of groups.

Here's the implementation based on this approach:

```python
def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    result = []
    balance = 0
    current_group = []

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == ' ':
            continue
        current_group.append(char)
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1
        
        # When balance is zero, we have a complete group
        if balance == 0 and current_group:
            result.append(''.join(current_group))
            current_group = []

    return result
```

This function should correctly separate the groups of balanced parentheses as specified in the problem statement.
