Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Parse the input string into individual letters
2. Count the frequency of each letter
3. Find the maximum frequency
4. Return all letters that have the maximum frequency

Let me trace through the examples:
- 'a b c' → each letter appears once → return all with count 1
- 'a b b a' → 'a' appears 2 times, 'b' appears 2 times → return both
- 'a b c a b' → 'a' appears 2 times, 'b' appears 2 times → return both
- 'b b b b a' → 'b' appears 4 times, 'a' appears 1 time → return only 'b'
- '' → empty string → return empty dict

```python
def histogram(test):
    if not test:
        return {}
    
    # Split the string into letters
    letters = test.split()
    
    # Count frequency of each letter
    count = {}
    for letter in letters:
        count[letter] = count.get(letter, 0) + 1
    
    # Find the maximum frequency
    max_count = max(count.values())
    
    # Return all letters with maximum frequency
    return {letter: count for letter, count in count.items() if count == max_count}
```
