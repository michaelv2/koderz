 The problem requires us to create a list of size `n` where each element at index `i` is the factorial of `i` if `i` is even or the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` if `i` is odd.

Here's how I plan to solve this:
- Initialize an empty list `result`.
- Iterate over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- For each number in the range, check if it's even or odd.
- If it's even, calculate its factorial and append it to the `result` list.
- If it's odd, calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to that number and append it to the `result` list.
- Finally, return the `result` list.

Now I will write the Python function implementing this plan.
```python
def f(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            factorial = 1
            for j in range(1, i+1):
                factorial *= j
            result.append(factorial)
        else:
            sum_nums = sum(range(1, i+1))
            result.append(sum_nums)
    return result
```
