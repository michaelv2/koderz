 The problem is asking to write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns the sum of the ASCII codes of all uppercase characters in the string. To solve this, we can iterate through each character in the string, check if it's an uppercase letter using the `isupper()` method, and if so, add its ASCII code to a running total.

Here is the Python function that implements this:

```python
def digitSum(s):
    return sum(ord(c) for c in s if c.isupper())
```

In this solution, `ord(c)` returns the ASCII code of character `c`, and `sum()` adds up all these values that satisfy the condition `if c.isupper()`.
