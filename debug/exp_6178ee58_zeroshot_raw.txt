 The problem is about creating a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with each element incremented by 1. To solve this problem, we can use a list comprehension to iterate through the input list and add 1 to each element.

Here's the complete function implementation:

```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    return [x + 1 for x in l]
```
