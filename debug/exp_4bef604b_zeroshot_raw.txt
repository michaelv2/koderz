Let me reason through this problem:

1. I need to track the maximum value seen so far as I iterate through the list
2. For each position, I output the maximum value encountered from the start up to that position
3. For the example [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]:
   - Position 0: max so far = 1
   - Position 1: max so far = 2
   - Position 2: max so far = 3
   - Position 3: max so far = 3 (not 2)
   - Position 4: max so far = 3 (not 3)
   - Position 5: max so far = 4
   - Position 6: max so far = 4 (not 2)

The approach is straightforward: maintain a running maximum and append it to the result list for each element.

```python
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.
    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
    if not numbers:
        return []
    
    result = []
    current_max = numbers[0]
    
    for num in numbers:
        current_max = max(current_max, num)
        result.append(current_max)
    
    return result
```
