Let me think through this problem:

1. I need to split a string by both commas and spaces
2. I should return a list of individual words
3. I need to handle cases where there are both commas and spaces as separators
4. I should remove any empty strings that might result from splitting

The approach:
- I can replace commas with spaces first, then split by spaces
- Or I can use regex to split by both commas and spaces
- I need to filter out empty strings that might result from multiple consecutive separators

```python
def words_string(s):
    """
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    """
    # Replace commas with spaces and split by whitespace
    # This handles both comma and space separators
    words = s.replace(",", " ").split()
    return words
```

The solution works by:
1. `replace(",", " ")` - converts all commas to spaces
2. `split()` - splits by any whitespace and automatically filters out empty strings from consecutive separators
