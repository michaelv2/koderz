Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Track opening and closing parentheses to identify complete groups
2. Ignore spaces
3. When a group is balanced (open count equals close count), it's complete
4. Add complete groups to the result list

The approach:
- Iterate through the string, skipping spaces
- Keep a counter for nesting depth (increment on '(', decrement on ')')
- When depth returns to 0, we have a complete group
- Collect characters for each group and add to result when complete

```python
from typing import List


def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    >>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
    ['()', '(())', '(()())']
    """
    result = []
    current_group = ""
    depth = 0
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == ' ':
            continue
        
        current_group += char
        
        if char == '(':
            depth += 1
        elif char == ')':
            depth -= 1
        
        # When depth returns to 0, we have a complete group
        if depth == 0 and current_group:
            result.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
    
    return result
```
