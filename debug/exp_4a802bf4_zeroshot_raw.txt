To solve this problem, we need to compute the average of integers from `n` to `m`, round the result to the nearest integer, and convert it to a binary string. If `n` is greater than `m`, we should return `-1`.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Check if `n` is greater than `m`. If so, return `-1`.
2. Calculate the sum of integers from `n` to `m` using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
3. Compute the average by dividing the sum by the number of terms (`m - n + 1`).
4. Round the average to the nearest integer.
5. Convert the rounded average to a binary string using Python's built-in `bin()` function.

Now, let's implement this in code:

```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if n > m:
        return -1
    total_sum = (m - n + 1) * (n + m) // 2
    count = m - n + 1
    average = round(total_sum / count)
    return bin(average)
```
