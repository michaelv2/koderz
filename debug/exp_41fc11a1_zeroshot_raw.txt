To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the list and check two conditions for each element:
1. The element is odd.
2. The index of the element is even.

If both conditions are met, we add the element to a running sum. Finally, we return the sum.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def solution(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.
    
    Examples
    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12
    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9
    solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==>0
    """
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 != 0:
            total_sum += lst[i]
    return total_sum
```
