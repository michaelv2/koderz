To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the list of integers and keep track of the elements that have already been seen. We can use a dictionary to store the count of each element. Then, we can create a new list that includes only those elements that appear exactly once.

Here's the implementation:

```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
    count = {}
    result = []
    
    for num in numbers:
        if num in count:
            count[num] += 1
        else:
            count[num] = 1
    
    for num in numbers:
        if count[num] == 1:
            result.append(num)
    
    return result
```
