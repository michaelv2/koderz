To solve this problem, we need to analyze each group of parentheses separately and determine the maximum depth of nested parentheses for each group. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Split the Input String**: First, split the input string by spaces to get individual groups of parentheses.
2. **Initialize Counters**: For each group, initialize counters to keep track of the current depth of nesting and the maximum depth encountered.
3. **Iterate Through Characters**: Loop through each character in the group:
   - If the character is an opening parenthesis `(`, increase the current depth by 1.
   - If the character is a closing parenthesis `)`, decrease the current depth by 1.
   - Update the maximum depth if the current depth exceeds it.
4. **Store Results**: After processing each group, store the maximum depth found for that group in a list.
5. **Return the List**: Finally, return the list of maximum depths for all groups.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    # Split the input string into individual groups
    groups = paren_string.split()
    
    # Initialize a list to store the maximum depth for each group
    max_depths = []
    
    # Process each group separately
    for group in groups:
        current_depth = 0
        max_depth = 0
        
        # Iterate through each character in the group
        for char in group:
            if char == '(':
                current_depth += 1
                # Update max depth if current depth is greater
                if current_depth > max_depth:
                    max_depth = current_depth
            elif char == ')':
                current_depth -= 1
        
        # Append the maximum depth of this group to the list
        max_depths.append(max_depth)
    
    return max_depths
```

This function will correctly compute the deepest level of nesting for each group of parentheses in the input string.
