 The problem is about creating a pile of stones with a given number of levels, where the number of stones in each level follows a specific pattern based on whether the initial number of stones is odd or even. To solve this problem, we can use a loop to iterate through the number of levels and calculate the number of stones in each level based on the pattern.

Here's the Python function that implements this solution:

```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n += 2
        else:
            n += 2
        pile.append(n)
    return pile
```

In this function, we first initialize a list `pile` with the initial number of stones `n`. Then, we use a loop to iterate through the remaining levels. In each iteration, we check if `n` is even or odd and increment it accordingly by 2 to get the number of stones in the next level. We then append this value to the `pile` list. Finally, we return the `pile` list containing the number of stones in each level.
