To solve this problem, we need to compute the derivative of a polynomial given its coefficients. The derivative of a polynomial term \(a_n \cdot x^n\) is \(n \cdot a_n \cdot x^{n-1}\). Therefore, for each coefficient in the list (except the first one), we multiply it by its corresponding power index and return the new list of coefficients.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def derivative(xs: list):
    """ xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
     Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
    """
    return [i * xs[i] for i in range(1, len(xs))]
```
