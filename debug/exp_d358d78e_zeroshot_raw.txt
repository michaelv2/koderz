 The problem is about finding the median of a list of numbers. To solve this, we first sort the list and then find the middle element(s). If the length of the list is odd, the median is the middle number. If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

Here's how I plan to implement the function:
1. Sort the input list in ascending order.
2. Calculate the length of the sorted list.
3. Check if the length is odd or even.
4. If it's odd, return the middle element.
5. If it's even, return the average of the two middle elements.

Now I will write and execute the Python function to solve this problem.
```python
def median(l: list):
    l.sort()
    n = len(l)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (l[n//2 - 1] + l[n//2]) / 2
    else:
        return l[n//2]
```
