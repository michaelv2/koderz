 The problem is about finding the largest divisor of a given number `n` that is smaller than `n`. To solve this, we can iterate through all numbers from `n-1` to 1 and check if they divide `n` evenly. If we find such a number, we return it as the result.

Here's the Python function implementation:

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```
