To solve this problem, we need to compare the total number of characters in two lists of strings and return the list with fewer characters. If both lists have the same number of characters, we should return the first list.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Calculate the total number of characters in `lst1`.
2. Calculate the total number of characters in `lst2`.
3. Compare the two totals.
4. Return the list with fewer characters, or `lst1` if they are equal.

Let's implement this logic in the function:

```python
def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    total_chars_lst1 = sum(len(s) for s in lst1)
    total_chars_lst2 = sum(len(s) for s in lst2)
    
    if total_chars_lst1 < total_chars_lst2:
        return lst1
    else:
        return lst2
```
