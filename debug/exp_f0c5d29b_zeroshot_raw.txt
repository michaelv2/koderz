To determine if a number \( n \) can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, we need to consider the properties of even numbers and their sums:

1. The smallest sum of 4 positive even numbers is \( 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 \).
2. Any sum of even numbers is also even.
3. Therefore, \( n \) must be at least 8 and even to be expressible as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.

Given these points, we can conclude:
- If \( n < 8 \), it's impossible for \( n \) to be written as such a sum.
- If \( n \geq 8 \) and \( n \) is even, then it can be written as the sum of four positive even numbers (e.g., \( n = 2 + 2 + 2 + (n - 6) \)).

With this reasoning, we can implement the function:

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0
```
