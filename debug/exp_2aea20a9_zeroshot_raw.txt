Looking at this problem, I need to check if any rotation of string `b` is a substring of string `a`.

Let me think through the approach:
1. If `b` is empty, it should return True (empty string is substring of any string)
2. For each possible rotation of `b`, check if it exists in `a`
3. A rotation of `b` can be generated by taking `b[i:] + b[:i]` for all valid `i`
4. However, there's a more efficient approach: if we concatenate `b` with itself, all rotations of `b` will appear as substrings of this concatenation

Let me trace through the examples:
- `cycpattern_check("abcd","abd")` => False: No rotation of "abd" is in "abcd"
- `cycpattern_check("hello","ell")` => True: "ell" is directly in "hello"
- `cycpattern_check("whassup","psus")` => False: No rotation of "psus" is in "whassup"
- `cycpattern_check("abab","baa")` => True: "baa" is a rotation of "aab" which is in "abab"? Wait, let me recheck this...
- Actually, "baa" is not a rotation of "baa" - it's "baa" itself. But "baa" is not in "abab". Let me reconsider...

Wait, let me re-read the problem. Looking at the examples more carefully:
- `cycpattern_check("abab","baa")` => True: This suggests that some rotation of "baa" is in "abab"
- Rotations of "baa": "baa", "aab", "aba"
- "aab" is not in "abab", but "aba" is in "abab" - so this works!

Actually, let me reconsider the example. The function should check if ANY rotation of `b` is a substring of `a`.

The efficient approach is to concatenate `b` with itself, and then check if `a` is a substring of this concatenation. But that's not right either.

Let me think again:
- We want to check if any rotation of `b` is a substring of `a`
- A key insight: if we concatenate `b` with itself (let's call it `b+b`), then every rotation of `b` will appear as a substring of `b+b`
- So we can check if `a` contains any substring of `b+b` that has the same length as `b`

Actually, let me re-read the examples once more to make sure I understand:
- `cycpattern_check("abab","baa")` => True: "baa" is not a rotation of "baa" that's in "abab". 
- Wait, let me check: rotations of "baa" are "baa", "aab", "aba"
- "aba" is in "abab" - so this works!

The approach:
1. Generate all rotations of `b`
2. Check if any of these rotations is a substring of `a`

But there's a smarter way: if we concatenate `b` with itself, then all rotations of `b` will be substrings of this concatenation. So we can check if `a` contains any substring of length `len(b)` from `b+b`.

Actually, let me just go with the straightforward approach first:

```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    if not b:
        return True
    
    # Generate all rotations of b
    for i in range(len(b)):
        rotation = b[i:] + b[:i]
        if rotation in a:
            return True
    
    return False
```
