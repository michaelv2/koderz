I need to determine if a list is monotonically increasing (non-decreasing) or monotonically decreasing (non-increasing).

My approach:
1. A list is monotonically increasing if each element is >= the previous element
2. A list is monotonically decreasing if each element is <= the previous element
3. I need to check if the list satisfies either condition
4. Empty lists and single-element lists are trivially monotonic

I can compare the list with its sorted version (for increasing) and its reverse sorted version (for decreasing).

```python
def monotonic(l: list):
    """Return True is list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.
    >>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
    True
    >>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
    False
    >>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
    True
    """
    return l == sorted(l) or l == sorted(l, reverse=True)
```
