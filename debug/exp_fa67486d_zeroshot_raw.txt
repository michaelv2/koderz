To solve the problem of factorizing an integer into its prime factors, we can use a straightforward approach:

1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.
2. Divide the given number by this prime as long as it is divisible.
3. Move to the next potential factor and repeat the process until the number becomes 1.
4. Collect all the prime factors in a list and return it.

This approach ensures that we get all the prime factors in ascending order, and each factor appears the correct number of times.

```python
def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    divisor = 2
    while n > 1:
        while n % divisor == 0:
            factors.append(divisor)
            n //= divisor
        divisor += 1
    return factors
```
