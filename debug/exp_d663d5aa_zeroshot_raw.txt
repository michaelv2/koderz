To solve this problem, we need to calculate the strength of each extension based on the given formula (number of uppercase letters minus number of lowercase letters). We will iterate through the list of extensions, compute the strength for each one, and keep track of the strongest extension found so far. If two extensions have the same strength, we choose the first one in the list.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    def calculate_strength(extension):
        cap = sum(1 for c in extension if c.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for c in extension if c.islower())
        return cap - sm

    strongest_extension = None
    max_strength = float('-inf')

    for extension in extensions:
        strength = calculate_strength(extension)
        if strength > max_strength:
            max_strength = strength
            strongest_extension = extension

    return f"{class_name}.{strongest_extension}"
```
