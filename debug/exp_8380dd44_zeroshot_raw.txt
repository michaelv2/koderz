Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Split the string into words
2. For each word, count the consonants
3. Keep only words with exactly n consonants
4. Return them in the order they appeared

A consonant is any letter that is not a vowel (a, e, i, o, u).

Let me trace through an example:
- "Mary had a little lamb" with n=4
- "Mary": M, r, y = 3 consonants (a is vowel)
- "had": h, d = 2 consonants (a is vowel)
- "a": 0 consonants
- "little": l, t, t, l = 4 consonants (i, e are vowels) ✓
- "lamb": l, m, b = 3 consonants (a is vowel)
- Result: ["little"]

Another example:
- "Mary had a little lamb" with n=3
- "Mary": M, r, y = 3 consonants ✓
- "had": h, d = 2 consonants
- "a": 0 consonants
- "little": l, t, t, l = 4 consonants
- "lamb": l, m, b = 3 consonants ✓
- Result: ["Mary", "lamb"]

```python
def select_words(s, n):
    if not s:
        return []
    
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    words = s.split()
    result = []
    
    for word in words:
        consonant_count = sum(1 for char in word if char.isalpha() and char not in vowels)
        if consonant_count == n:
            result.append(word)
    
    return result
```
