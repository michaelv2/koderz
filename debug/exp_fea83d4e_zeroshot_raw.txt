 The problem is about creating a Python function that takes a string of space-separated lowercase letters as input and returns a dictionary containing the letter(s) with the most repetition and their corresponding count. If several letters have the same occurrence, all of them should be returned in the dictionary.

Here's how I plan to solve this problem:
1. Split the input string into a list of words using the `split()` function.
2. Create an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each word.
3. Iterate through the list of words and update their frequencies in the dictionary.
4. Find the maximum frequency from the dictionary values.
5. Iterate through the dictionary again and add the keys (words) with the maximum frequency to a new dictionary.
6. Return the new dictionary containing the letter(s) with the most repetition and their corresponding count.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
def histogram(test):
    words = test.split()
    freq_dict = {}
    for word in words:
        if word in freq_dict:
            freq_dict[word] += 1
        else:
            freq_dict[word] = 1
    max_freq = max(freq_dict.values(), default=0)
    result_dict = {}
    for word, freq in freq_dict.items():
        if freq == max_freq:
            result_dict[word] = freq
    return result_dict
```
