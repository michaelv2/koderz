```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```
This function works by iterating from `n-1` down to `1`. For each number, it checks whether the remainder of `n / i` is zero (i.e., `n` is divisible by `i`). If such a number is found, it returns that number as the largest divisor of `n`.
