Let me reason through this problem:

1. I need to find the smallest even value in the array
2. If there are multiple occurrences of the smallest even value, I should return the one with the smallest index
3. Return the value and its index as a list [value, index]
4. If no even values exist or the array is empty, return []

Approach:
- Iterate through the array with indices
- Track even numbers and keep the smallest one
- When I find an even number, compare it with the current smallest even (if any)
- Since I'm iterating from left to right, the first occurrence of the smallest even will automatically have the smallest index

```python
def pluck(arr):
    """
    Returns the smallest even value and its index, or empty list if no even values.
    """
    if not arr:
        return []
    
    smallest_even = None
    smallest_index = None
    
    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        # Check if the number is even
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # If this is the first even number or smaller than the current smallest even
            if smallest_even is None or num < smallest_even:
                smallest_even = num
                smallest_index = i
    
    # Return the result or empty list
    if smallest_even is not None:
        return [smallest_even, smallest_index]
    else:
        return []
```
