```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    # Check if the range includes an even number
    for i in range(y, x-1, -1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            return i
    return -1
```
This function works by iterating from `y` to `x` (inclusive) and checking each number if it's even. If an even number is found, the function immediately returns that number. If no even number is found in the range, the function returns `-1`.
