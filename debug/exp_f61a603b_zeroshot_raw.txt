Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Find all prime numbers less than n
2. Return them in an array in ascending order
3. Handle edge cases like n <= 1

Let me think through the approach:
- I need a helper function to check if a number is prime
- For each number from 2 to n-1, check if it's prime
- Collect all prime numbers in a list and return it

A number is prime if:
- It's greater than 1
- It's only divisible by 1 and itself
- I can optimize by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number

```python
def count_up_to(n):
    def is_prime(num):
        if num < 2:
            return False
        if num == 2:
            return True
        if num % 2 == 0:
            return False
        for i in range(3, int(num**0.5) + 1, 2):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(i):
            primes.append(i)
    return primes
```
