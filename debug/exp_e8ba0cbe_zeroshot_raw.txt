To determine if a given string is a palindrome, we need to check if the string reads the same forwards and backwards. An empty string is considered a palindrome by definition.

Here's the implementation of the `is_palindrome` function:

```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    return text == text[::-1]
```

This function works by comparing the original string to its reverse (`text[::-1]`). If they are the same, the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.
