To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each string in the input list, count the number of odd digits in each string, and then replace all occurrences of 'i' with the count of odd digits in the corresponding string.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the results.
2. Iterate through each string in the input list.
3. For each string, count the number of odd digits.
4. Replace all occurrences of 'i' in the template string with the count of odd digits.
5. Append the modified string to the result list.
6. Return the result list.

```python
def odd_count(lst):
    result = []
    for s in lst:
        odd_count = sum(1 for char in s if int(char) % 2 != 0)
        result.append(f"the number of odd elements {odd_count}n the str{odd_count}ng {odd_count} of the {odd_count}nput.")
    return result
```
