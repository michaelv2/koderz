Looking at this problem, I need to find and return the maximum element from a list.

The straightforward approach is to use Python's built-in `max()` function, which efficiently finds the maximum element in an iterable.

```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """
    return max(l)
```
