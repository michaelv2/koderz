 The problem is about finding the coordinates of a given integer in a 2-dimensional list (similar to a matrix but with varying column lengths). The solution involves iterating through each row and column of the list, checking for the target integer, and storing its coordinates in a list of tuples. The final result should be sorted first by rows in ascending order and then by columns in descending order.

Here's my plan:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the coordinates.
2. Iterate through each row and column of the input list.
3. If the current element is equal to the target integer, append its coordinates (row index and column index) as a tuple to the list.
4. Sort the list of tuples first by rows in ascending order and then by columns in descending order.
5. Return the sorted list of tuples.

Now I'll write the Python function that implements this plan:

```python
def get_row(lst, x):
    coordinates = []
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(len(lst[i])):
            if lst[i][j] == x:
                coordinates.append((i, len(lst[i]) - 1 - j))
    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    return coordinates
```
