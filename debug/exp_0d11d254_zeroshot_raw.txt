To solve this problem, we need to check three conditions:
1. All inputs must be integers.
2. One of the numbers should be equal to the sum of the other two.

We can use the `isinstance` function to verify if all inputs are integers. Then, we can check the sum condition using simple equality checks.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    if isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int):
        return x == y + z or y == x + z or z == x + y
    return False
```
