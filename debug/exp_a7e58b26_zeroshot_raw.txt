Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Find the largest prime number in the list
2. Calculate the sum of digits of that prime number

Let me break this down:
- First, I need a helper function to check if a number is prime
- Then, I need to find all prime numbers in the list
- Among those primes, find the largest one
- Finally, calculate the sum of digits of that largest prime

Let me trace through the first example to verify my understanding:
- lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3]
- Prime numbers in this list: 3, 2, 5, 7, 2, 3, 2, 3
- Largest prime: 181
- Sum of digits of 181: 1 + 8 + 1 = 10 ✓

```python
def skjkasdkd(lst):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n < 2:
            return False
        if n == 2:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return False
        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    def sum_of_digits(n):
        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    
    # Find all prime numbers in the list
    primes = [num for num in lst if is_prime(num)]
    
    # If no primes found, return 0 (though based on examples, there should be primes)
    if not primes:
        return 0
    
    # Find the largest prime
    largest_prime = max(primes)
    
    # Return the sum of its digits
    return sum_of_digits(largest_prime)
```
