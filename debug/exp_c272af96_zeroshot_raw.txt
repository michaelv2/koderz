To solve the problem of rescaling a list of numbers such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the minimum and maximum values in the list.
2. Subtract the minimum value from each number to shift all values so that the minimum is now 0.
3. Divide each number by the range (max - min) to scale all values between 0 and 1.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("List must contain at least two elements")
    
    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)
    range_val = max_val - min_val
    
    return [(x - min_val) / range_val for x in numbers]
```
