To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the list and check for even numbers that are located at odd indices. We will sum these numbers and return the result.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum.
2. Loop through the list using an index to access both the value and its position.
3. Check if the index is odd and if the element at that index is even.
4. If both conditions are met, add the element to the sum.
5. Return the final sum after the loop completes.

```python
def add(lst):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):  # Start from index 1 and step by 2 to get odd indices
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:  # Check if the element is even
            total += lst[i]
    return total
```
