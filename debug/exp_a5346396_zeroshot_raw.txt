To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Split the input string into individual letters.
2. Count the occurrences of each letter.
3. Identify the maximum occurrence count.
4. Collect all letters that have this maximum occurrence count.
5. Return a dictionary with these letters and their counts.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def histogram(test):
    if not test:
        return {}
    
    # Split the input string into individual letters
    letters = test.split()
    
    # Count the occurrences of each letter
    from collections import Counter
    letter_counts = Counter(letters)
    
    # Find the maximum occurrence count
    max_count = max(letter_counts.values())
    
    # Collect all letters that have this maximum occurrence count
    result = {letter: count for letter, count in letter_counts.items() if count == max_count}
    
    return result
```
