Looking at this problem, I need to implement a simple addition function that takes two integers and returns their sum.

The function signature is `add(x: int, y: int)` and it should return the sum of x and y. The docstring shows two examples:
- `add(2, 3)` should return `5`
- `add(5, 7)` should return `12`

This is a straightforward implementation where I just need to return the sum of the two input parameters.

```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```
