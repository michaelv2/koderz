To solve this problem, we need to construct a list where each element represents the number of stones at each level of the pile. The first level starts with `n` stones. For subsequent levels, if `n` is odd, the next level should have the next odd number of stones, and if `n` is even, the next level should have the next even number of stones.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize the list with the first element as `n`.
2. Determine whether `n` is odd or even.
3. Use a loop to generate the required number of levels (`n` levels in total).
4. In each iteration, calculate the next number based on the current level's parity (odd/even) and append it to the list.

Let's implement this logic in the function:

```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    current_stones = n
    
    for _ in range(1, n):
        if current_stones % 2 == 0:
            current_stones += 2
        else:
            current_stones += 2
        pile.append(current_stones)
    
    return pile
```

This function initializes the list with `n` stones and then iteratively adds the next odd or even number of stones based on the current count, ensuring that the correct sequence is maintained.
