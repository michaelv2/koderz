```
This function first finds the intersection of two intervals by finding the maximum start value and minimum end value. If this intersection has a negative length (which means that the intervals don't intersect), it returns "NO". Otherwise, it calculates the length of the intersection and checks if it is prime using the `is_prime` helper function.
