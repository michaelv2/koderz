Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Take two binary strings `a` and `b` 
2. Perform XOR operation on corresponding bits
3. Return the result as a string

Let me trace through the example:
- `a = '010'`, `b = '110'`
- Position 0: `0 XOR 1 = 1`
- Position 1: `1 XOR 1 = 0` 
- Position 2: `0 XOR 0 = 0`
- Result: `'100'`

I need to ensure both strings are the same length (though the problem doesn't specify what to do if they're different lengths, I'll assume they're equal based on the example).

```python
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    result = ""
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            result += "0"
        else:
            result += "1"
    return result
```
