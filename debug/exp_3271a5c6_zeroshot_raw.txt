I need to flip the case of each character in a string - lowercase becomes uppercase and uppercase becomes lowercase.

The simplest approach is to use Python's built-in `swapcase()` method, which does exactly this. Alternatively, I could iterate through each character and use `isupper()` / `islower()` with conditional logic.

```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    """ For a given string, flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase.
    >>> flip_case('Hello')
    'hELLO'
    """
    return string.swapcase()
```
