```python
def unique_digits(x):
    return sorted([i for i in x if all(int(j) % 2 != 0 for j in str(i))])
```

This function works by iterating over each number in the input list, converting it to a string and then checking if every digit is odd. If it is, the number is added to the output list. The final result is sorted in increasing order.
