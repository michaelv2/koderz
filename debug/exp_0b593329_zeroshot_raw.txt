 The problem is about finding the count of even and odd integer palindromes within a given range (1 to n). To solve this, we can iterate through each number in the range, check if it's a palindrome, and then determine whether it's even or odd.

Here's how I plan to implement the function:

1. Initialize two variables `even_count` and `odd_count` to keep track of the count of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.
2. Iterate through each number in the range from 1 to n (inclusive).
3. For each number, convert it to a string and check if it's equal to its reverse. If yes, then it's a palindrome.
4. If the number is a palindrome, check if it's even or odd by using the modulo operator. Increment the corresponding count variable.
5. Finally, return a tuple containing `even_count` and `odd_count`.

Now, let's write the Python code for this function:

```python
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:
            if i % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1

    return (even_count, odd_count)
```
