To solve this problem, we need to determine if there is at least one nested subsequence of square brackets in the given string. A subsequence is considered nested if it contains an inner pair of brackets.

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement the function:

1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the depth of nesting.
2. Iterate through each character in the string.
3. If the character is an opening bracket `[`, increment the depth counter.
4. If the character is a closing bracket `]`, decrement the depth counter.
5. If at any point the depth counter is greater than 1, it means there is a nested subsequence.
6. If the depth counter never exceeds 1 after processing all characters, return `False`.

```python
def is_nested(string):
    depth = 0
    max_depth = 0
    
    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            depth += 1
            max_depth = max(max_depth, depth)
        elif char == ']':
            depth -= 1
        
        if depth < 0:
            return False  # Early exit if we encounter more closing brackets than opening ones
    
    return max_depth > 1
```
