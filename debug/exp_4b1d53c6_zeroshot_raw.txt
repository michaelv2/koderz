To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists at least one pair of brackets that are properly nested within the given string. A valid subsequence of brackets is considered nested if there is an opening bracket followed by another opening bracket before encountering its corresponding closing bracket.

Here's a step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of unmatched opening brackets.
2. Traverse through each character in the string.
3. Increment the counter when encountering an opening bracket '['.
4. Decrement the counter when encountering a closing bracket ']'.
5. If at any point the counter is greater than 1, it means there is at least one nested pair of brackets, and we can return True.
6. If we finish traversing the string without finding such a condition, return False.

```python
def is_nested(string):
    open_brackets = 0
    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            open_brackets += 1
        elif char == ']':
            open_brackets -= 1
        # If there are more than one unmatched opening brackets, we have a nested structure
        if open_brackets > 1:
            return True
    return False
```
