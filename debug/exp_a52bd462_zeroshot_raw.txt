To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of unique characters in a given string, ignoring case differences. Here's how I plan to approach it:

1. Convert the entire string to either lower or upper case to ensure that character comparison is case-insensitive.
2. Use a set to store characters because sets automatically handle duplicates and only keep unique elements.
3. Iterate through each character in the string, add it to the set, and let the set manage uniqueness.
4. Finally, return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters.

Let's implement this approach:

```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of """
    lower_string = string.lower()
    unique_chars = set(lower_string)
    return len(unique_chars)
```

This function will correctly count the number of distinct characters in the input string, treating uppercase and lowercase versions of the same character as identical.
