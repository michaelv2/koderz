To implement the `fib` function that returns the n-th Fibonacci number, we can use an iterative approach to ensure efficiency. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

Given the examples in the problem statement, it seems that the function should be 1-indexed (i.e., `fib(1)` returns 1). However, typically Fibonacci sequences are 0-indexed. To match the given examples, we will implement a 1-indexed version.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the iterative approach:
1. Initialize two variables to store the first two Fibonacci numbers: `a = 0` and `b = 1`.
2. Use a loop to iterate from 1 to n.
3. In each iteration, update the values of `a` and `b` such that `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a + b`.
4. After the loop ends, `b` will hold the n-th Fibonacci number.

This approach runs in O(n) time complexity and uses O(1) space complexity.

```python
def fib(n: int):
    """Return n-th Fibonacci number."""
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(1, n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b
```
