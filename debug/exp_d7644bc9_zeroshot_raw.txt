To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given number \( n \) can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. 

### Reasoning:
1. The smallest sum of 4 positive even numbers is \( 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 \).
2. Any number less than 8 cannot be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.
3. For any number \( n \geq 8 \), we can always find four positive even numbers that sum up to \( n \) by starting with the smallest even numbers and adjusting accordingly.

### Implementation:
- If \( n \) is less than 8, return `False`.
- Otherwise, return `True`.

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers"""
    if n < 8:
        return False
    else:
        return True
```
