To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the word from right to left and find a vowel that is surrounded by consonants. We will ignore vowels at the beginning or end of the word. Here's how we can implement this:

1. Define a set of vowels for easy lookup.
2. Iterate over the word from the second-to-last character to the second character (to avoid the first and last characters).
3. Check if the current character is a vowel and if it is surrounded by consonants.
4. If such a vowel is found, return it immediately as we are iterating from right to left.
5. If no such vowel is found after the loop, return an empty string.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    for i in range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1):
        if word[i] in vowels and word[i-1] not in vowels and word[i+1] not in vowels:
            return word[i]
    return ""
```
