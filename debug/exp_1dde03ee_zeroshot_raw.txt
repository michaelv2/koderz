Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Build an algebraic expression using the given operators and operands
2. Evaluate the expression following proper order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)
3. The operators are applied between consecutive operands

Let me trace through the example:
- operators: ['+', '*', '-']
- operands: [2, 3, 4, 5]
- Expression: 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
- Following order of operations: 2 + (3 * 4) - 5 = 2 + 12 - 5 = 9

I need to evaluate the expression respecting operator precedence. The standard approach is to:
1. First handle exponentiation (**)
2. Then handle multiplication (*), division (//), and modulo (%)
3. Finally handle addition (+) and subtraction (-)

However, since the problem doesn't specify a particular order and the example shows left-to-right evaluation for same precedence, I should check if it's left-to-right evaluation or proper precedence.

Looking more carefully at the example: 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 = 9
If we do left-to-right: (2 + 3) * 4 - 5 = 5 * 4 - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15 (wrong)
If we do proper precedence: 2 + (3 * 4) - 5 = 2 + 12 - 5 = 9 (correct)

So it seems like we need to respect operator precedence. But let me re-read... 

Actually, looking at the problem again, it says "build the algebraic expression and return the evaluation". The example shows 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 = 9, which is the standard mathematical evaluation with precedence.

But wait, let me think about this differently. The problem might be asking for a simple left-to-right evaluation, but that would contradict the example.

Let me just implement the standard mathematical evaluation with proper operator precedence.

```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    # Create the expression by combining operands and operators
    expression = []
    for i in range(len(operand)):
        expression.append(str(operand[i]))
        if i < len(operator):
            expression.append(operator[i])
    
    # Convert to string and evaluate
    expr_str = ''.join(expression)
    
    # We need to be careful about operator precedence
    # Let's build it step by step with proper precedence
    
    # First, let's create a proper expression string
    result = operand[0]
    for i in range(len(operator)):
        if operator[i] == '+':
            result += operand[i+1]
        elif operator[i] == '-':
            result -= operand[i+1]
        elif operator[i] == '*':
            result *= operand[i+1]
        elif operator[i] == '//':
            result //= operand[i+1]
        elif operator[i] == '**':
            result **= operand[i+1]
    
    return result
```

Wait, this approach doesn't respect precedence. Let me reconsider the problem.

Looking at the example again: 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 = 9
This is clearly standard mathematical evaluation where * has higher precedence than + and -.

But the problem description says "build the algebraic expression" and then "return the evaluation". The example shows the standard mathematical result.

However, I think I should just evaluate it properly with precedence. But let me check if there's a simpler interpretation.

Actually, let me just implement a proper evaluation respecting operator precedence:

```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    # Build the expression as a list of numbers and operators
    expr = []
    for i in range(len(operand)):
        expr.append(operand[i])
        if i < len(operator):
            expr.append(operator[i])
    
    # Evaluate with proper precedence
    # First pass: handle ** (right to left)
    i = len(expr) - 2
    while i >= 0:
        if expr[i] == '**':
            expr[i-1] = expr[i-1] ** expr[i+1]
            expr.pop(i)
            expr.pop(i)
        i -= 2
    
    # Second pass: handle * and // (left to right)
    i = 1
    while i < len(expr):
        if expr[i] == '*':
            expr[i-1] = expr[i-1] * expr[i+1]
            expr.pop(i)
            expr.pop(i)
        elif expr[i] == '//':
            expr[i-1] = expr[i-1] // expr[i+1]
            expr.pop(i)
            expr.pop(i)
        else:
            i += 2
    
    # Third pass: handle + and - (left to right)
    i = 1
    while i < len(expr):
        if expr[i] == '+':
            expr[i-1] = expr[i-1] + expr[i+1]
            expr.pop(i)
            expr.pop(i)
        elif expr[i] == '-':
            expr[i-1] = expr[i-1] - expr[i+1]
            expr.pop(i)
            expr.pop(i)
        else:
            i += 2
    
    return expr[0]
```
