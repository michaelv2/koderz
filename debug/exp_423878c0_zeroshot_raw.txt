Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Remove all characters from string `s` that appear in string `c`
2. Check if the resulting string is a palindrome
3. Return a tuple with the result string and the palindrome check result

Let me trace through the examples:
- s = "abcde", c = "ae": Remove 'a' and 'e' from "abcde" → "bcd", check if "bcd" is palindrome → False
- s = "abcdef", c = "b": Remove 'b' from "abcdef" → "acdef", check if "acdef" is palindrome → False  
- s = "abcdedcba", c = "ab": Remove 'a' and 'b' from "abcdedcba" → "cdedc", check if "cdedc" is palindrome → True

```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    # Create a set of characters to delete for efficient lookup
    chars_to_delete = set(c)
    
    # Filter out characters that are in the deletion set
    result = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in chars_to_delete)
    
    # Check if the result is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = result == result[::-1]
    
    return (result, is_palindrome)
```
