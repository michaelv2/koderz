To solve this problem, we need to generate all possible prefixes of a given string, starting from the shortest to the longest. A prefix is any initial segment of a string.

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement the `all_prefixes` function:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the prefixes.
2. Iterate through the string using a loop, appending each substring from the start up to the current index to the list.
3. Return the list containing all the prefixes.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
from typing import List

def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string """
    prefixes = []
    for i in range(1, len(string) + 1):
        prefixes.append(string[:i])
    return prefixes
```

This function iterates through the indices of the string (from 1 to the length of the string), slicing the string up to each index and appending it to the `prefixes` list. Finally, it returns the list of all prefixes.
