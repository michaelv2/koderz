To solve this problem, we need to extract the decimal part of a given positive floating point number. This can be achieved by subtracting the integer part of the number from the original number. The integer part can be obtained using the `int()` function which truncates the decimal portion.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    return number - int(number)
```
