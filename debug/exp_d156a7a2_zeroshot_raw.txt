To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each character in the string `s`. If the character is a letter, we will reverse its case using Python's built-in string methods `str.upper()` and `str.lower()`. If the character is not a letter, we will leave it unchanged. Additionally, if the string contains no letters at all, we will reverse the entire string.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the modified characters.
2. Use a flag to check if there are any letters in the string.
3. Iterate through each character in the string:
   - If it's a letter, change its case and add to the list.
   - If it's not a letter, add it unchanged to the list.
4. After processing all characters, check the flag:
   - If there were no letters, reverse the entire list of characters.
5. Join the list into a string and return it.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
def solve(s):
    modified_chars = []
    has_letters = False
    
    for char in s:
        if char.isalpha():
            has_letters = True
            if char.islower():
                modified_chars.append(char.upper())
            else:
                modified_chars.append(char.lower())
        else:
            modified_chars.append(char)
    
    if not has_letters:
        modified_chars.reverse()
    
    return ''.join(modified_chars)
```
