Let me reason through this:

The `encode_cyclic` function:
1. Splits the string into groups of 3 characters
2. For each group of exactly 3 characters, it cycles them: `group[1:] + group[0]` (moves first char to end)
3. Groups with fewer than 3 characters are left unchanged

To decode, I need to reverse this process:
- For groups of 3 characters, I need to reverse the cycling operation
- If encoding does: `abc` → `bca`, then decoding should do: `bca` → `abc`
- To reverse `group[1:] + group[0]`, I need to move the last character to the front: `group[-1] + group[:-1]`
- Groups with fewer than 3 characters stay the same

```python
def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # reverse cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)
```
