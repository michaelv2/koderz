To solve this problem, we need to determine the intersection of two intervals and check if the length of this intersection is a prime number. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Find the Intersection**: The intersection of two intervals \((a, b)\) and \((c, d)\) can be found by taking the maximum of the starting points and the minimum of the ending points. This gives us the interval \((\max(a, c), \min(b, d))\).

2. **Check for Valid Intersection**: If the calculated start of the intersection is greater than the end, then there is no intersection.

3. **Calculate Length**: The length of the intersection interval is \(\text{end} - \text{start} + 1\) because the intervals are closed (inclusive of both endpoints).

4. **Prime Check**: We need a helper function to check if a number is prime. A number is prime if it is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

5. **Return Result**: If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES". Otherwise, return "NO".

Here's the implementation:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    start1, end1 = interval1
    start2, end2 = interval2
    
    # Find the intersection interval
    start_intersection = max(start1, start2)
    end_intersection = min(end1, end2)
    
    # Check if there is a valid intersection
    if start_intersection > end_intersection:
        return "NO"
    
    # Calculate the length of the intersection
    length = end_intersection - start_intersection + 1
    
    # Check if the length is a prime number
    if is_prime(length):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```
