Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Start with `n` stones at level 1
2. For each subsequent level, add the next odd or even number based on whether the current number is odd or even
3. Continue for `n` levels total
4. Return a list of stone counts

Let me trace through the example:
- `make_a_pile(3)`: Start with 3 (odd)
  - Level 1: 3 stones (odd)
  - Level 2: next odd after 3 is 5
  - Level 3: next odd after 5 is 7
  - Result: [3, 5, 7] ✓

The pattern is: if a number is odd, the next odd number is `current + 2`. If it's even, the next even number is `current + 2`.

So in both cases, we just add 2 to get the next number of the same parity!

```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = []
    stones = n
    for i in range(n):
        pile.append(stones)
        stones += 2
    return pile
```
