Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Take a list of operators and a list of operands
2. Build an algebraic expression by interleaving them
3. Evaluate the expression following standard order of operations

For example:
- operators: ['+', '*', '-']
- operands: [2, 3, 4, 5]
- expression: 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
- evaluation: 2 + 12 - 5 = 9

The key insight is that I can build a string representation of the expression and use Python's `eval()` function, which will automatically respect operator precedence. Alternatively, I could manually evaluate, but `eval()` is appropriate here since we're building the expression ourselves from validated inputs.

Let me construct the expression by alternating between operands and operators:

```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    """
    Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and 
    the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric 
    expression and return the evaluation of this expression.

    The basic algebra operations:
    Addition ( + ) 
    Subtraction ( - ) 
    Multiplication ( * ) 
    Floor division ( // ) 
    Exponentiation ( ** ) 

    Example:
    operator['+', '*', '-']
    array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
    => result = 9

    Note:
        The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
        Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
        Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.

    """
    # Build the expression by interleaving operands and operators
    expression = str(operand[0])
    for i in range(len(operator)):
        expression += " " + operator[i] + " " + str(operand[i + 1])
    
    # Evaluate and return the result
    return eval(expression)
```
