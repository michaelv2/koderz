Let me analyze this problem:

1. We need to split the string by spaces to identify words
2. For each word, sort the characters by their ASCII values
3. Keep the order of words and the blank spaces in their original positions
4. Join everything back together

The key insight is that we need to:
- Split by spaces while preserving the spaces themselves
- Sort characters within each word by ASCII value
- Recombine maintaining original word/space positions

Let me trace through an example:
- "Hello World!!!" 
- Words: ["Hello", "World!!!"]
- Sort "Hello": H(72), e(101), l(108), l(108), o(111) → "Hello" (H comes first in ASCII)
- Sort "World!!!": W(87), o(111), r(114), l(108), d(100), !(33), !(33), !(33) → "!!!Wdlor"
- Result: "Hello !!!Wdlor" ✓

```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    words = s.split(' ')
    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]
    return ' '.join(sorted_words)
```
