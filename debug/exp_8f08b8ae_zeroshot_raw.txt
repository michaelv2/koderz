To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Check if the array is empty and return `None` if it is.
2. Initialize variables to keep track of the sum of magnitudes and the product of signs.
3. Iterate through each number in the array:
   - Add the absolute value of the number to the sum of magnitudes.
   - Multiply the sign of the number (1 for positive, -1 for negative, 0 for zero) to the product of signs.
4. Return the result of multiplying the sum of magnitudes by the product of signs.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    if not arr:
        return None
    
    sum_of_magnitudes = 0
    product_of_signs = 1
    
    for num in arr:
        sum_of_magnitudes += abs(num)
        if num > 0:
            product_of_signs *= 1
        elif num < 0:
            product_of_signs *= -1
        else:
            product_of_signs *= 0
    
    return sum_of_magnitudes * product_of_signs
```
