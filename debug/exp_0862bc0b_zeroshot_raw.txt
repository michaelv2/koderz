 The problem is about checking whether every opening bracket in a string of "<" and ">" has a corresponding closing bracket. To solve this, we can use a counter to keep track of the number of unmatched opening brackets. If we encounter a closing bracket while the counter is zero, or if the counter is not zero at the end, then the bracketing is incorrect.

Here's the Python function that implements this solution:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    unmatched = 0
    for b in brackets:
        if b == '<':
            unmatched += 1
        elif b == '>':
            if unmatched == 0:
                return False
            else:
                unmatched -= 1
    return unmatched == 0
```
