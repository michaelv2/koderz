To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to exchange elements between two lists such that all elements in the first list (`lst1`) become even. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Odd Elements in `lst1`**: We need to count how many odd elements are present in `lst1`.
2. **Check for Even Elements in `lst2`**: We need to check if there are enough even elements in `lst2` to replace all the odd elements in `lst1`.

If the number of even elements in `lst2` is greater than or equal to the number of odd elements in `lst1`, then it's possible to make all elements in `lst1` even by exchanging. Otherwise, it's not possible.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    # Count the number of odd elements in lst1
    odd_count = sum(1 for x in lst1 if x % 2 != 0)
    
    # Count the number of even elements in lst2
    even_count = sum(1 for x in lst2 if x % 2 == 0)
    
    # Check if there are enough even elements in lst2 to replace all odd elements in lst1
    if even_count >= odd_count:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

This function first counts the number of odd elements in `lst1` and the number of even elements in `lst2`. It then compares these counts to determine if the exchange is possible. If there are enough even elements in `lst2` to replace all odd elements in `lst1`, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".
