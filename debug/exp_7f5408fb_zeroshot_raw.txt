To solve this problem, we need to count the total number of water units (represented by `1`s) in the grid and then determine how many times we need to lower the buckets to extract all the water, given the bucket capacity.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Traverse the grid and count the total number of `1`s.
2. Divide this total by the bucket capacity to find out how many full bucket loads are needed.
3. If there is any remainder when dividing the total water units by the bucket capacity, we need one additional lowering of the bucket.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    total_water_units = sum(sum(row) for row in grid)
    return math.ceil(total_water_units / capacity)
```

This function first calculates the total number of water units by summing up all the `1`s in the grid. It then uses `math.ceil` to determine the number of times we need to lower the bucket, which accounts for any remaining water that doesn't fill a complete bucket.

```python
import math

def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    total_water_units = sum(sum(row) for row in grid)
    return math.ceil(total_water_units / capacity)
```
