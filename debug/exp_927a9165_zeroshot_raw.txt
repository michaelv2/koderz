To solve this problem, we need to implement a simple function that takes two integer arguments and returns their sum. The function is already named `add`, and the docstring provides examples of how it should work.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. Define the function with the name `add`.
2. Specify that the function takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, both of which are integers.
3. Implement the logic to add these two integers.
4. Return the result of the addition.

The examples in the docstring indicate that `add(2, 3)` should return `5` and `add(5, 7)` should return `12`. These examples confirm that we simply need to use the `+` operator to add the two numbers.

```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers x and y"""
    return x + y
```

This implementation correctly adds the two integers and returns the result.
