To solve this problem, we need to create a function that takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the original list, sorted in ascending order.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Convert the list to a set to remove duplicate elements.
2. Convert the set back to a list.
3. Sort the list in ascending order.
4. Return the sorted list.

This approach ensures that we get unique elements and then sort them, which is exactly what the problem statement requires.

```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list"""
    return sorted(set(l))
```
