```python
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
    
    # Check all possible combinations of three prime numbers
    for i in range(len(primes)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(primes)):
            for k in range(j+1, len(primes)):
                if primes[i] * primes[j] * primes[k] == a:
                    return True
    return False
```
This function works by first defining all the prime numbers less than 100. Then it checks every possible combination of three different prime numbers to see if their product equals `a`. If such a combination is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This approach assumes that `a` is an integer and that it's less than 100.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3), where n is the number of prime numbers less than 100 (which is a constant value). The space complexity is also O(1) because we are using a fixed amount of space to store the primes.
