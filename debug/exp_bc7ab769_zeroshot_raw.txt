To solve the problem of checking if every opening bracket `<` has a corresponding closing bracket `>`, we can use a stack data structure. The stack will help us keep track of the opening brackets as we encounter them and ensure that each one is properly closed.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through each character in the input string.
3. If the character is an opening bracket `<`, push it onto the stack.
4. If the character is a closing bracket `>`, check if the stack is not empty (meaning there is a corresponding opening bracket). If the stack is empty, return `False` because there is no matching opening bracket. Otherwise, pop the top element from the stack.
5. After iterating through all characters, check if the stack is empty. If it is, return `True` because all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets. If the stack is not empty, return `False` because there are unmatched opening brackets.

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == '>':
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    
    return len(stack) == 0
```
