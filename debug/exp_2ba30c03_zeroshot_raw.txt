To solve the problem of creating the shortest palindrome that starts with a given string, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the longest palindromic suffix of the input string.
2. Determine the prefix of the string that is not part of this palindromic suffix.
3. Reverse this prefix and append it to the end of the original string to form the shortest palindrome.

Here's the implementation of the `make_palindrome` function:

```python
def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    if not string:
        return string
    
    # Find the longest palindromic suffix
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if is_palindrome(string[i:]):
            # Append the reverse of the prefix before this suffix to the original string
            return string + string[:i][::-1]
    
    return string  # This line should never be reached because the loop will always find a palindromic suffix (at least the last character)
```

This function uses the helper function `is_palindrome` to check if a substring is a palindrome. It iterates over possible starting points for the palindromic suffix and constructs the shortest palindrome by appending the reverse of the non-palindromic prefix.
