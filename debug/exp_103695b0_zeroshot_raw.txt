 The problem is about counting the number of odd digits in each string of a given list of strings and replacing certain parts of a predefined sentence with these counts. To solve this, I will create a helper function to count the number of odd digits in a string. Then, I'll use this helper function to replace the necessary parts of the sentence for each string in the input list.

Here is my plan:
1. Define a helper function `count_odd` that takes a string and returns the count of odd digits in it.
2. In the main function `odd_count`, iterate over the input list, apply the `count_odd` function to each string, and replace the necessary parts of the sentence with these counts.
3. Return the modified sentences as a list.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
def odd_count(lst):
    def count_odd(s):
        return sum(1 for c in s if int(c) % 2 != 0)

    result = []
    for i, s in enumerate(lst):
        count = count_odd(s)
        sentence = "the number of odd elements {}n the str{}ng {} of the {}nput.".format(count, count, count, count)
        result.append(sentence)
    return result
```
