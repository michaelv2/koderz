To determine if an integer \( a \) is a cube of some integer number, we can take the following approach:

1. Compute the cube root of \( a \).
2. Check if the cube of the rounded value of this cube root equals \( a \).

This method ensures that we correctly identify whether \( a \) is a perfect cube.

```python
def iscube(a):
    # Calculate the cube root of 'a'
    cube_root = round(a ** (1/3))
    
    # Check if the cube of the rounded cube root equals 'a'
    return cube_root ** 3 == a
```
