Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Find vowels that are between two consonants
2. Look from the right side of the word
3. Ignore vowels at the beginning and end
4. Return the closest such vowel from the right
5. Return empty string if none found

Let me trace through the examples:
- "yogurt": from right, 't' is consonant, 'r' is consonant, 'u' is vowel between 'r' and 't' → "u"
- "FULL": from right, 'L' is consonant, 'L' is consonant, 'U' is vowel between 'L' and 'L' → "U" 
- "quick": from right, 'k' is consonant, 'c' is consonant, 'u' is vowel but 'q' is consonant on left, 'i' is vowel, 'c' is consonant on right → no vowel between two consonants → ""
- "ab": only two letters, no vowel can be between two consonants → ""

Let me implement this step by step:

```python
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    if len(word) < 3:
        return ""
    
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    
    # Iterate from right to left, but skip the last character (end)
    for i in range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1):
        # Check if current character is a vowel
        if word[i] in vowels:
            # Check if it's between two consonants
            if word[i-1] not in vowels and word[i+1] not in vowels:
                return word[i]
    
    return ""
```
