To solve this problem, we need to convert a given decimal number to its binary representation and format it with 'db' at the beginning and end of the resulting string.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Convert the decimal number to binary using Python's built-in `bin()` function.
2. The `bin()` function returns a string prefixed with '0b', so we need to remove this prefix.
3. Concatenate 'db' at the beginning and end of the binary string.
4. Return the formatted string.

Now, let's implement this in the function:

```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary_str = bin(decimal)[2:]  # Convert to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    return f"db{binary_str}db"     # Format with 'db' at the beginning and end
```
