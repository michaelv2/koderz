```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i-1]:
            return i
    return -1
```

This function works by iterating over the array from end to start. If it finds an element that is less than its preceding element, it returns the index of that element. If no such element is found after checking all elements, it returns -1.
