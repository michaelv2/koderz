Let me break down the requirements:

1. Check if the list is sorted in ascending order
2. Allow at most 1 duplicate of any number (no more than 2 occurrences of the same number)
3. Return False if any number appears more than twice
4. Assume non-negative integers only

My approach:
1. Iterate through the list and check if it's in ascending order
2. Count occurrences of each number and ensure no number appears more than twice
3. Return True only if both conditions are met

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    # Check if list is sorted in ascending order
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    
    # Check if any number has more than 1 duplicate (appears more than twice)
    from collections import Counter
    counts = Counter(lst)
    for count in counts.values():
        if count > 2:
            return False
    
    return True
```
