To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that generates a list of prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, return an empty list because there are no prime numbers less than 2.
2. For each number from 2 up to (but not including) `n`, check if it is a prime number.
3. To check if a number is prime, test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these, it is not prime.
4. Collect all numbers that pass the prime check into a list and return this list.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def count_up_to(n):
    def is_prime(num):
        if num <= 1:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    primes = [num for num in range(2, n) if is_prime(num)]
    return primes
```
