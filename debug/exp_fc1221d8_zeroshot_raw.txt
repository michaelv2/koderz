Let me break down this problem:

1. I need to find all palindromic numbers in the range [1, n)
2. Count how many are even and how many are odd
3. Return a tuple (even_count, odd_count)

A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. For example:
- Single digit numbers (1-9) are all palindromes
- 11, 22, 33, etc. are palindromes
- 121, 131, 141, etc. are palindromes

My approach:
1. Iterate through numbers from 1 to n-1 (since range is inclusive of n but the examples show we check up to n-1)
2. For each number, check if it's a palindrome by converting to string and comparing with its reverse
3. If it's a palindrome, check if it's even or odd and increment the appropriate counter
4. Return the tuple of (even_count, odd_count)

Wait, let me verify with the examples:
- Example 1: n=3, range is [1,3), so we check 1,2. But output says palindromes are 1,2,3. So it should be [1,n] inclusive.
- Example 2: n=12, palindromes listed are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11. That's [1,11], so it's [1,n-1] or [1,n) depending on how you interpret it.

Looking more carefully at example 1: "range(1, n)" would be range(1, 3) = [1, 2], but the explanation says palindromes are 1, 2, 3. This suggests the problem statement says "range(1, n)" but actually means [1, n] inclusive. Let me check example 2 again: with n=12, they list palindromes up to 11, which is [1, 11]. So it seems like [1, n-1] or equivalently range(1, n).

Actually, re-reading: "fall within the range(1, n), inclusive" - this is a bit ambiguous. But based on the examples, range(1, n) in Python terms (which is [1, n-1]) seems correct for example 2, but example 1 shows up to 3 when n=3.

Let me reconsider: maybe "range(1, n)" in the problem description is pseudo-code meaning [1, n]. Let me verify with example 1: if n=3 and we include 3, we get 1,2,3 - all palindromes, 1 even (2) and 2 odd (1,3). That matches!

For example 2: if n=12 and we go up to 11, we get 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11 - that's 4 even (2,4,6,8) and 6 odd (1,3,5,7,9,11). That matches!

So it seems the range is [1, n-1] or Python's range(1, n).

```python
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd
    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.
    """
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    for num in range(1, n):
        # Check if the number is a palindrome
        num_str = str(num)
        if num_str == num_str[::-1]:
            # It's a palindrome
            if num % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1
    
    return (even_count, odd_count)
```
