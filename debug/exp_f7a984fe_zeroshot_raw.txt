Let me reason through this:

1. I need to check if the length of a string is a prime number
2. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself
3. I'll create a helper function to check if a number is prime
4. Then apply it to the length of the input string

Let me verify with the examples:
- 'Hello' has length 5 (prime) → True ✓
- 'abcdcba' has length 7 (prime) → True ✓
- 'kittens' has length 7 (prime) → True ✓
- 'orange' has length 6 (not prime, divisible by 2,3) → False ✓

```python
def prime_length(string):
    """Write a function that takes a string and returns True if the string
    length is a prime number or False otherwise
    """
    length = len(string)
    
    # Numbers less than 2 are not prime
    if length < 2:
        return False
    
    # Check if length is prime
    for i in range(2, int(length ** 0.5) + 1):
        if length % i == 0:
            return False
    
    return True
```
