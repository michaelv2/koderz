To solve this problem, we need to calculate the "Brazilian factorial" for a given integer `n`. The Brazilian factorial is defined as the product of all factorials from `n!` down to `1!`.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. We need a helper function to compute the factorial of a number.
2. We then iterate from `n` down to `1`, computing the factorial for each number and multiplying these factorials together.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    def factorial(x):
        if x == 0 or x == 1:
            return 1
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, x + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
    
    brazilian_factorial = 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        brazilian_factorial *= factorial(i)
    
    return brazilian_factorial
```
