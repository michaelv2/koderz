To solve this problem, we need to multiply two fractions represented as strings and check if the result is a whole number. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Parse the input strings to extract numerators and denominators.
2. Multiply the numerators together and the denominators together to get the resulting fraction.
3. Check if the resulting fraction is a whole number by verifying if the numerator is divisible by the denominator without a remainder.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
def simplify(x, n):
    # Parse the fractions
    num1, denom1 = map(int, x.split('/'))
    num2, denom2 = map(int, n.split('/'))
    
    # Multiply numerators and denominators
    result_num = num1 * num2
    result_denom = denom1 * denom2
    
    # Check if the result is a whole number
    return result_num % result_denom == 0
```
