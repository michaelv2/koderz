To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the input string while keeping track of the balance of parentheses and forming separate groups when a balanced group is found.

Here's a step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the resulting groups.
2. Use a counter to keep track of the balance of parentheses.
3. Iterate through each character in the input string, ignoring spaces.
4. When encountering an opening parenthesis '(', increment the balance counter.
5. Append characters to a current group string.
6. When encountering a closing parenthesis ')', decrement the balance counter.
7. If the balance counter reaches zero, it means we have found a complete balanced group. Add this group to the result list and reset the current group string and balance counter.

```python
def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    groups = []
    current_group = ""
    balance = 0
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == ' ':
            continue
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1
        
        current_group += char
        
        if balance == 0:
            groups.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
    
    return groups
```
