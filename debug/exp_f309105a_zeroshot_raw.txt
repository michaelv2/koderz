To solve this problem, we need to convert a given decimal number to its binary representation and format it with 'db' at the beginning and end of the string.

Here's a step-by-step approach:
1. Convert the decimal number to its binary representation using Python's built-in `bin()` function.
2. Remove the '0b' prefix that `bin()` adds to the result.
3. Prepend and append 'db' to the resulting binary string.

Let's implement this in the function:

```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    # Convert the decimal number to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]
    
    # Format the binary string with 'db' at the beginning and end
    formatted_binary = f"db{binary}db"
    
    return formatted_binary
```
