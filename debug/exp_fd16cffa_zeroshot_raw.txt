Let me think through this problem:

1. I need to check if a number is the product of exactly 3 prime numbers
2. The number `a` is less than 100
3. For example, 30 = 2 × 3 × 5 (three primes)

My approach:
- Find the prime factorization of the number
- Count how many prime factors there are (counting multiplicity)
- Return True if exactly 3 prime factors, False otherwise

For example:
- 30 = 2 × 3 × 5 → 3 prime factors → True
- 8 = 2 × 2 × 2 → 3 prime factors → True
- 27 = 3 × 3 × 3 → 3 prime factors → True
- 12 = 2 × 2 × 3 → 3 prime factors → True
- 15 = 3 × 5 → 2 prime factors → False

```python
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """Returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers."""
    prime_count = 0
    
    # Check for factor 2
    while a % 2 == 0:
        prime_count += 1
        a //= 2
    
    # Check for odd factors from 3 onwards
    divisor = 3
    while divisor * divisor <= a:
        while a % divisor == 0:
            prime_count += 1
            a //= divisor
        divisor += 2
    
    # If a is still greater than 1, then it's a prime factor
    if a > 1:
        prime_count += 1
    
    return prime_count == 3
```
