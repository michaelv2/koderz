```python
import math

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    # Check if the three sides can form a valid triangle
    if (a + b > c) and (b + c > a) and (c + a > b):
        # Calculate semi-perimeter
        s = (a + b + c) / 2.0
        # Use Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle
        return round(math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), 2)
    else:
        return -1
```
This function first checks if the three sides can form a valid triangle by checking if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If they do, it calculates the semi-perimeter of the triangle and uses Heron's formula to calculate the area. The result is then rounded to 2 decimal points and returned. If the three sides cannot form a valid triangle, -1 is returned.
