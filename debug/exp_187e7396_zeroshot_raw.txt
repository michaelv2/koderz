Looking at this problem, I need to find if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

Let me think through the approach:
1. I need to check all pairs of distinct elements
2. For each pair, check if their sum equals zero
3. Return True if such a pair exists, False otherwise

I can use a nested loop approach or a more efficient approach using a set. Let me go with the set approach for better efficiency:

- For each element in the list, I'll check if its negative counterpart exists in a set
- If it does, I've found a pair that sums to zero
- I'll need to be careful about the case where an element is 0 and appears twice

Actually, let me reconsider the examples:
- `[1, 3, 5, 0]` → False (0 is there but no -0)
- `[1, 3, -2, 1]` → False (no pair sums to 0)
- `[2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]` → True (5 and -5 sum to 0)

So I need to check if there's a pair of distinct elements that sum to zero.

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    seen = set()
    for num in l:
        if -num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```
