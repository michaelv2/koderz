Problem analysis:
- Core challenge: From a list of arbitrary Python values, extract only those that are integers, preserving their original order.
- Constraints: Return a list of ints; include all values that are instances of int (note: in Python, bool is a subclass of int, so True/False would be included unless explicitly excluded).

Implementation specification:
- Input: values, a list of elements of any type (List[Any]).
- Output: a list containing only elements from values that are instances of int, preserving the input order (List[int]).
- Behavior: For each element in values, if isinstance(element, int) is True, include it in the result; otherwise, skip it.

```python
from typing import List, Any

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """Return a list containing only the integer values from the input, preserving order."""
    return [v for v in values if isinstance(v, int)]
```
