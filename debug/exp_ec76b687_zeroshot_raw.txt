Looking at this problem, I need to implement a function that filters a list of strings to only include those that contain a given substring.

Let me analyze the requirements:
1. Take a list of strings and a substring as input
2. Return a new list containing only strings that contain the substring
3. Handle edge cases like empty lists

The function should iterate through each string in the input list and check if the substring is contained within each string using the `in` operator. If the substring is found, include that string in the result.

```python
from typing import List


def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain given substring
    >>> filter_by_substring([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
    ['abc', 'bacd', 'array']
    """
    return [string for string in strings if substring in string]
```
