Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Count the total number of water units (1s) in the grid
2. Calculate how many bucket operations are needed based on the bucket capacity
3. Since we can't do partial bucket operations, I need to round up to the nearest whole number

Let me trace through the examples:
- Example 1: grid has 6 ones total, capacity=1, so 6/1 = 6 operations
- Example 2: grid has 7 ones total, capacity=2, so 7/2 = 3.5 → round up to 4 operations
- Example 3: grid has 0 ones total, capacity=5, so 0/5 = 0 operations

Wait, let me recheck example 2 more carefully:
Grid: [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]
Row 1: 2 ones
Row 2: 0 ones  
Row 3: 4 ones
Row 4: 3 ones
Total: 9 ones
But the expected output is 5, not 5. Let me recount:
Row 1: [0,0,1,1] → 2 ones
Row 2: [0,0,0,0] → 0 ones
Row 3: [1,1,1,1] → 4 ones  
Row 4: [0,1,1,1] → 3 ones
Total: 9 ones

Hmm, that doesn't match. Let me re-read... 

Actually, let me just implement the logic correctly - count all 1s in the grid, then divide by capacity and round up.

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    
    # Count total water units (1s) in the grid
    total_water = 0
    for row in grid:
        total_water += sum(row)
    
    # If no water, no operations needed
    if total_water == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate number of bucket operations needed (round up)
    return math.ceil(total_water / capacity)
```
