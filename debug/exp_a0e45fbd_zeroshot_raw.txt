Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Calculate how many carrots I'll eat in total (already eaten + needed)
2. Check if there are enough remaining carrots
3. If yes, eat the needed amount and calculate remaining
4. If no, eat all remaining carrots and still be hungry (need to eat what's left)

Let me trace through the examples:
- eat(5, 6, 10): Already ate 5, need 6 more. Have 10 remaining. Eat 6, total = 5+6=11, remaining = 10-6=4
- eat(4, 8, 9): Already ate 4, need 8 more. Have 9 remaining. Eat 8, total = 4+8=12, remaining = 9-8=1
- eat(1, 10, 10): Already ate 1, need 10 more. Have 10 remaining. Eat 10, total = 1+10=11, remaining = 10-10=0
- eat(2, 11, 5): Already ate 2, need 11 more. Have 5 remaining. Can only eat 5, total = 2+5=7, remaining = 0

```python
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    if need <= remaining:
        # Enough carrots available
        total_eaten = number + need
        carrots_left = remaining - need
    else:
        # Not enough carrots, eat all remaining
        total_eaten = number + remaining
        carrots_left = 0
    
    return [total_eaten, carrots_left]
```
