To solve this problem, we need to extract the decimal part of a given positive floating point number. The decimal part is what remains after removing the integer part from the original number. In Python, we can achieve this by using the `math.modf` function which returns the fractional and integer parts of a number as a tuple, or by simply subtracting the integer part (obtained using `int()`) from the original number.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. We take the input floating point number.
2. We extract the integer part of the number using the `int()` function which truncates the decimal portion.
3. We subtract this integer part from the original number to get the decimal part.
4. We return the decimal part.

Let's implement this in code:

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    an integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    """
    return number - int(number)
```
