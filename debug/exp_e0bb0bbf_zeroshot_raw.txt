To solve this problem, we need to count the number of times a given substring appears in the original string, including overlapping occurrences. This can be achieved by iterating through the string and checking for the substring starting at each position.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    count = 0
    start = 0
    while start <= len(string) - len(substring):
        if string[start:start + len(substring)] == substring:
            count += 1
        start += 1
    return count
```
