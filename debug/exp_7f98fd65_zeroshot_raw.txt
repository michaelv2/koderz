Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Split the string into words
2. For each word, count the number of consonants (letters that are not vowels)
3. Return words that have exactly n consonants
4. Handle empty string case

Let me trace through the examples:
- "Mary had a little lamb", n=4: "little" has 4 consonants (l,t,t,l), "Mary" has 2, "lamb" has 2, so only "little" matches
- "Mary had a little lamb", n=3: "Mary" has 2 consonants, "lamb" has 2, "little" has 4, so none match? Wait, let me recheck...

Actually, let me be more careful:
- "Mary" (M-r-y): M, R, Y are consonants = 3 consonants
- "lamb" (l-m-b): L, M, B are consonants = 3 consonants  
- "little" (l-t-t-l): L, T, T, L are consonants = 4 consonants

So for n=3, "Mary" and "lamb" should match.

Let me implement this step by step:

```python
def select_words(s, n):
    if not s:
        return []
    
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    result = []
    
    words = s.split()
    
    for word in words:
        consonant_count = 0
        for char in word:
            if char.isalpha() and char not in vowels:
                consonant_count += 1
        
        if consonant_count == n:
            result.append(word)
    
    return result
```
