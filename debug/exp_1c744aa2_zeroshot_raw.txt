To solve this problem, we need to compute the derivative of a polynomial given its coefficients. The input list `xs` represents the coefficients of the polynomial in increasing order of powers of `x`. That is, `xs[0]` is the constant term, `xs[1]` is the coefficient of `x`, `xs[2]` is the coefficient of `x^2`, and so on.

The derivative of a polynomial can be computed by applying the power rule: for each term `a_n * x^n`, the derivative is `n * a_n * x^(n-1)`. This means that:
- The constant term (the first element in the list) disappears because its derivative is 0.
- For each subsequent term, we multiply the coefficient by its power index and reduce the power by one.

Given this rule, we can iterate over the list of coefficients starting from the second element (index 1), multiply each coefficient by its index, and collect these results in a new list. This new list will represent the coefficients of the derivative polynomial.

Here's the implementation of the `derivative` function:

```python
def derivative(xs: list):
    """ xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
     Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
    """
    return [i * xs[i] for i in range(1, len(xs))]
```

This code uses a list comprehension to generate the new list of coefficients by iterating over the indices starting from 1 (since the constant term's derivative is zero and can be ignored) and multiplying each coefficient by its respective power index.
