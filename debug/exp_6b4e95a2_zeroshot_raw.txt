Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Find groups of consecutive spaces
2. If a group has 1-2 spaces, replace with underscore(s)
3. If a group has 3+ spaces, replace with a single dash

Let me trace through the examples:
- "Example" → "Example" (no spaces)
- "Example 1" → "Example_1" (1 space → 1 underscore)
- " Example 2" → "_Example_2" (1 space at start → 1 underscore, 1 space in middle → 1 underscore)
- " Example   3" → "_Example-3" (1 space at start → 1 underscore, 3 spaces → dash)

The key insight is to iterate through the text, count consecutive spaces, and replace them based on their count.

```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(text):
        if text[i] == ' ':
            # Count consecutive spaces
            space_count = 0
            while i < len(text) and text[i] == ' ':
                space_count += 1
                i += 1
            
            # Replace based on count
            if space_count >= 3:
                result.append('-')
            else:
                result.append('_' * space_count)
        else:
            result.append(text[i])
            i += 1
    
    return ''.join(result)
```
