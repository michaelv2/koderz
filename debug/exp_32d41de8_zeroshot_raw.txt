Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Remove all elements that occur more than once in the list
2. Keep the order of remaining elements the same as in the input
3. Only keep elements that appear exactly once

My approach:
1. Count the frequency of each number
2. Filter the original list to keep only numbers that appear exactly once
3. Maintain the original order

```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
    # Count frequency of each number
    freq = {}
    for num in numbers:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Keep only numbers that appear exactly once, maintaining order
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if freq[num] == 1:
            result.append(num)
    
    return result
```
