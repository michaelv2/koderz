Let me reason through this:

1. I need to filter numbers that are:
   - Greater than 10
   - Have an odd first digit
   - Have an odd last digit

2. To get the first and last digits, I can convert the number to a string and check the first and last characters
3. For negative numbers, I need to handle the '-' sign properly
4. A digit is odd if it's in {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}

Here's my approach:
- Iterate through the array
- For each number, check if it's > 10
- Get the absolute value and convert to string to work with digits
- Check if first digit (index 0) is odd
- Check if last digit (index -1) is odd
- Count elements that satisfy all conditions

```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            # Convert to string and get absolute value to handle negatives
            s = str(abs(num))
            # Check if first digit is odd and last digit is odd
            first_digit = int(s[0])
            last_digit = int(s[-1])
            if first_digit % 2 == 1 and last_digit % 2 == 1:
                count += 1
    return count
```
