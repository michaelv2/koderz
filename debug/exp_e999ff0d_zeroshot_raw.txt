Let me reason through this:

1. We need to check if brackets are properly balanced
2. Each "<" (opening bracket) must have a corresponding ">" (closing bracket)
3. A closing bracket ">" cannot appear before its matching opening bracket "<"
4. We can track this with a counter:
   - Increment counter for each "<"
   - Decrement counter for each ">"
   - If counter goes negative at any point, we have a ">" without a matching "<"
   - At the end, counter must be 0 (all brackets matched)

Let me trace through the examples:
- "<": counter goes to 1, ends at 1 (unmatched) → False ✓
- "<>": counter goes 1, then 0 → True ✓
- "<<><>>": counter goes 1,2,1,2,1,0 → True ✓
- "><<>": counter goes -1 (immediately negative) → False ✓

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "<" and ">".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("<")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("<>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
    False
    """
    count = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == "<":
            count += 1
        elif char == ">":
            count -= 1
        
        # If count goes negative, we have a closing bracket without opening
        if count < 0:
            return False
    
    # At the end, count must be 0 for all brackets to be matched
    return count == 0
```
