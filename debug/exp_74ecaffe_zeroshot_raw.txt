```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    changes = 0
    i, j = 0, n - 1
    
    while i < j:
        if arr[i] != arr[j]:
            changes += 1
        
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    
    return changes
```

This function works by comparing the first and last elements of the array, then moving inwards. If the elements are not equal, it increments a counter (changes). This continues until the two pointers meet in the middle of the array. The number of changes is returned as the result.
