Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Iterate through each character in the input string
2. Check if the character is an uppercase letter (ASCII codes 65-90)
3. If it is uppercase, add its ASCII code to the sum
4. Return the total sum

Let me trace through the examples to verify my understanding:
- `digitSum("abAB")` should return 131
  - 'A' has ASCII 65
  - 'B' has ASCII 66  
  - 65 + 66 = 131 ✓

- `digitSum("abcCd")` should return 67
  - 'C' has ASCII 67
  - 67 ✓

```python
def digitSum(s):
    total = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            total += ord(char)
    return total
```
