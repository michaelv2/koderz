Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Check if the list is sorted in ascending order
2. Return False if there are more than 1 duplicate of the same number
3. Return True otherwise

Let me break this down:
- First, I need to check for duplicates - if any number appears more than twice, return False
- Then, I need to check if the list is sorted in ascending order
- The list is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next element

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    # Check for more than 1 duplicate (i.e., count > 2)
    from collections import Counter
    counts = Counter(lst)
    for count in counts.values():
        if count > 2:
            return False
    
    # Check if list is sorted in ascending order
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    
    return True
```
