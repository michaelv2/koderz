To solve this problem, we need to insert the `delimeter` between every two consecutive elements of the input list `numbers`. Here's how I plan to approach it:

1. **Check for an empty list**: If the input list is empty, return an empty list immediately since there are no elements to intersperse.
2. **Iterate through the list**: For a non-empty list, iterate through the elements and construct a new list by adding each element followed by the `delimeter`.
3. **Avoid trailing delimeter**: Ensure that the `delimeter` is not added after the last element of the list.

Here's the implementation based on this plan:

```python
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    if not numbers:
        return []
    
    result = []
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        result.append(numbers[i])
        if i < len(numbers) - 1:
            result.append(delimeter)
    
    return result
```

This function first checks if the input list is empty and returns an empty list if true. Otherwise, it iterates through the `numbers` list, appending each number to the `result` list followed by the `delimeter`, except after the last element.
