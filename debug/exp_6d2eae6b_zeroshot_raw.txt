To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the list of operations and keep a running total of the balance. If at any point this balance falls below zero, we should return `True`. If we finish processing all operations without the balance going negative, we return `False`.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize a variable `balance` to 0.
2. Iterate through each operation in the `operations` list.
3. Update the `balance` by adding the current operation value.
4. Check if the `balance` is less than 0 after updating it with the current operation.
5. If it is, return `True`.
6. If the loop completes without the balance going below zero, return `False`.

Let's implement this logic in the function:

```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
