```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    # If the list is empty or has only one element, it's already sorted
    if len(arr) < 2:
        return True
    
    # Find the index of the maximum value in the array
    max_index = arr.index(max(arr))
    
    # Check if the list is already sorted (non-decreasing order)
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[(i+1)%len(arr)] for i in range(len(arr))):
        return True
    
    # If not, perform right shift operations until we get to the maximum value
    while max_index != 0:
        arr = [arr[-1]] + arr[:-1]  # Perform one right shift operation
        max_index -= 1  # Decrease the index of the maximum value
    
    # Check if the list is sorted after performing the operations
    return all(arr[i] <= arr[(i+1)%len(arr)] for i in range(len(arr)))
```
This function works by first finding the index of the maximum element in the array. Then, it performs right shift operations until the maximum value is at the beginning of the array. After that, it checks if the list is sorted (non-decreasing order). If it's not, then it returns False; otherwise, True.
