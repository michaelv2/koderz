To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum `k` numbers in the given array and return them sorted in ascending order. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Sort the Array**: First, sort the entire array in descending order.
2. **Select the Top `k` Elements**: Take the first `k` elements from the sorted array.
3. **Sort the Selected Elements**: Finally, sort these `k` elements in ascending order before returning them.

This approach ensures that we get the largest `k` numbers and return them in the required sorted order.

```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    # Step 1: Sort the array in descending order
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Step 2: Select the top k elements
    top_k_elements = arr[:k]
    
    # Step 3: Sort the selected elements in ascending order
    top_k_elements.sort()
    
    return top_k_elements
```
