To solve the problem of counting the number of even and odd digits in an integer, we can follow these steps:

1. Convert the integer to its absolute value to handle negative numbers.
2. Initialize counters for even and odd digits.
3. Iterate through each digit of the number:
   - Check if the digit is even or odd using the modulus operator.
   - Increment the respective counter.
4. Return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits.

Here's the complete function implementation:

```python
def even_odd_count(num):
    """Given an integer, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively."""
    num = abs(num)  # Handle negative numbers by converting to absolute value
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    for digit in str(num):
        if int(digit) % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    
    return (even_count, odd_count)
```
