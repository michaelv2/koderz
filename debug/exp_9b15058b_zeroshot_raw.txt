Let me reason through this:

1. I need to create a string with numbers from 0 to n (inclusive)
2. The numbers should be separated by spaces
3. For n=0, return '0'
4. For n=5, return '0 1 2 3 4 5'

The straightforward approach is to:
- Generate numbers from 0 to n (inclusive)
- Convert each to a string
- Join them with spaces

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join(str(i) for i in range(n + 1))
```
