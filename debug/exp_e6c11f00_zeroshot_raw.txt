 The problem is about calculating the area of a triangle given its base length and height. To solve this, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle which is 0.5 * base * height.

Here's how I plan to implement the function:
1. Define a function called `triangle_area` that takes two arguments: `a` (the base length) and `h` (the height).
2. Calculate the area using the formula 0.5 * `a` * `h`.
3. Return the calculated area.

Now, let's write the Python code for this function.
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 0.5 * a * h
```
