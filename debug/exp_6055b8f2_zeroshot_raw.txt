 The problem is asking to find out if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum up to zero. To solve this, we can iterate through each pair of numbers in the list and check if their sum equals zero. If such a pair is found, return True; otherwise, return False after checking all pairs.

Here's my plan:
1. Define a function `pairs_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input.
2. Iterate through each pair of numbers in the list using two nested loops.
3. Check if the sum of the current pair equals zero and if they are distinct elements (i.e., not the same number).
4. If such a pair is found, return True.
5. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, return False.

Now I'll implement this in Python:

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    for i in range(len(l)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(l)):
            if l[i] + l[j] == 0 and l[i] != l[j]:
                return True
    return False
```
