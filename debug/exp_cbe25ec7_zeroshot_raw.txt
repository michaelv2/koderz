Looking at this problem, I need to create a function that:
1. Takes an integer `n`
2. Returns a string with numbers from 0 to n (inclusive) separated by spaces
3. Handles the edge case where n is 0

Let me trace through the examples:
- `string_sequence(0)` should return `'0'` 
- `string_sequence(5)` should return `'0 1 2 3 4 5'`

The approach is straightforward:
1. Generate numbers from 0 to n (inclusive)
2. Convert each number to a string
3. Join them with spaces

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """
    return ' '.join(str(i) for i in range(n + 1))
```
