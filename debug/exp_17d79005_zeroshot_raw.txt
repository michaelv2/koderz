 The problem is asking to sort the elements of a list that are at indices divisible by three while keeping the other elements unchanged. To solve this, we can follow these steps:

1. Extract the elements from the input list that are at indices divisible by three and store them in a separate list.
2. Sort this extracted list.
3. Replace the elements in the original list at indices divisible by three with the sorted elements.
4. Return the modified list.

Here is the Python function implementation:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    third_elements = [l[i] for i in range(2, len(l), 3)]
    third_elements.sort()
    sorted_list = l[:]
    for i, element in enumerate(third_elements):
        sorted_list[(i * 3) + 2] = element
    return sorted_list
```
