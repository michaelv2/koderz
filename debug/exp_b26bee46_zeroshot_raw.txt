Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Split the string into sentences using '.', '?', or '!' as delimiters
2. For each sentence, check if it starts with "I" (after stripping whitespace)
3. Count how many sentences start with "I"

Let me trace through the examples:
- "Hello world" - no sentences starting with "I", so return 0
- "The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather" - 3 sentences, only the last one starts with "I", so return 1

```python
def is_bored(S):
    import re
    
    # Split by sentence delimiters
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]+', S)
    
    count = 0
    for sentence in sentences:
        # Strip whitespace and check if it's not empty
        sentence = sentence.strip()
        if sentence and sentence.startswith('I'):
            count += 1
    
    return count
```
