Looking at this problem, I need to calculate the area of a triangle given:
- `a`: length of a side (base)
- `h`: height (perpendicular to that side)

The formula for the area of a triangle is: Area = (base × height) / 2

Let me verify with the example:
- base = 5, height = 3
- Area = (5 × 3) / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5 ✓

```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    return (a * h) / 2
```
