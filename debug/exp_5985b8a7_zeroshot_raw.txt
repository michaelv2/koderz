To solve the problem of determining if there are two distinct elements in a list that sum to zero, we can use a set to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far. As we iterate through the list, for each number, we check if its negation is already in the set. If it is, then we have found two numbers that sum to zero. If not, we add the current number to the set and continue.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    seen = set()
    for num in l:
        if -num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```

This approach ensures that we only need to traverse the list once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list.
