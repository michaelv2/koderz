Looking at this problem, I need to count how many times a substring appears in a string, including overlapping occurrences.

Let me trace through the examples:
- `how_many_times('', 'a')` → 0 (empty string)
- `how_many_times('aaa', 'a')` → 3 (the substring 'a' appears at positions 0, 1, and 2)
- `how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')` → 3 (the substring 'aa' appears at positions 0, 1, and 2)

For overlapping cases, I can't simply use `str.count()` because it doesn't count overlaps. I need to check each possible position in the string where the substring could start.

My approach:
1. Handle edge cases (empty string or substring)
2. Iterate through each possible starting position in the original string
3. At each position, check if the substring matches
4. Count all matches

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlaping cases.
    >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
    0
    >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
    3
    >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
    3
    """
    if not string or not substring:
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    start = 0
    
    while start <= len(string) - len(substring):
        if string[start:start + len(substring)] == substring:
            count += 1
        start += 1
    
    return count
```
