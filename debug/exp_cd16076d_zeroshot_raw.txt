To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the input string and keep track of the balance of parentheses. We will use a counter to determine when a group is balanced (i.e., when the count returns to zero). We will also ignore spaces as specified.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the resulting groups.
2. Use a counter to keep track of the balance of parentheses.
3. Iterate through each character in the string:
   - If it's an opening parenthesis '(', increment the counter and add it to the current group.
   - If it's a closing parenthesis ')', decrement the counter and add it to the current group.
   - If the counter reaches zero, it means we have a balanced group. Add this group to the result list and reset the current group string.
4. Ignore any spaces in the input string.

Now, let's implement this logic in the function:

```python
def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    groups = []
    current_group = ""
    balance = 0
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == ' ':
            continue
        current_group += char
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance == 0 and current_group:
            groups.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
    
    return groups
```
