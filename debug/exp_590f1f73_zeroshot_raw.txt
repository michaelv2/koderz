 The problem is about writing a Python function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string which is the concatenation of all the input strings. To solve this problem, we can use the `join()` method of the string class in Python, which concatenates all the elements of an iterable (such as a list) into a single string.

Here's the complete function implementation:

```python
from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    return ''.join(strings)
```
