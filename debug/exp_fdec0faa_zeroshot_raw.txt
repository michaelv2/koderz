To determine if a given integer `a` is a perfect cube of some integer, we can take the cube root of `a`, round it to the nearest integer, and then check if cubing this rounded value gives us back `a`. This approach works for both positive and negative integers as well as zero.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def iscube(a):
    # Calculate the cube root of a
    cube_root = round(a ** (1/3))
    # Check if cubing the rounded cube root gives back the original number
    return cube_root ** 3 == a
```

This function uses the `**` operator to compute the cube root and `round()` to handle rounding to the nearest integer. The final check ensures that the cubed value matches the original input, confirming it's a perfect cube.

```python
def iscube(a):
    cube_root = round(a ** (1/3))
    return cube_root ** 3 == a
```
