Let me reason through this problem:

1. I need to iterate through the list
2. For each number, I need to check if it:
   - Is an integer (not a float)
   - Is non-negative (>= 0)
   - Is odd
3. If all conditions are met, square it and add to the sum
4. Return the total sum

Key considerations:
- `isinstance(x, int)` to check if it's an integer (note: in Python, `bool` is a subclass of `int`, so I should exclude booleans)
- Check if `x >= 0` (non-negative)
- Check if `x % 2 != 0` (odd)
- Use `x ** 2` to square the number

```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    
    double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10
    double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
    double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
    double_the_difference([0]) == 0  
   
    If the input list is empty, return 0.
    '''
    total = 0
    for num in lst:
        # Check if it's an integer (but not a boolean), non-negative, and odd
        if isinstance(num, int) and not isinstance(num, bool) and num >= 0 and num % 2 != 0:
            total += num ** 2
    return total
```
