To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a set to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far as we iterate through the list. For each number in the list, we check if its negation (i.e., the number that would sum with it to zero) is already in the set. If it is, we return `True` because we found a pair that sums to zero. If not, we add the current number to the set and continue. This approach ensures that we only need to traverse the list once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

Here's the implementation:

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    seen = set()
    for num in l:
        if -num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```
