To solve this problem, we need to simplify the expression \( x \times n \) where both \( x \) and \( n \) are fractions represented as strings. The goal is to determine if the result of this multiplication evaluates to a whole number.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Parse the input strings \( x \) and \( n \) to extract their numerators and denominators.
2. Multiply the fractions \( x \times n \).
3. Check if the resulting fraction is a whole number by verifying if the numerator is divisible by the denominator.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
def simplify(x, n):
    # Parse the fractions
    num_x, denom_x = map(int, x.split('/'))
    num_n, denom_n = map(int, n.split('/'))
    
    # Multiply the fractions
    result_num = num_x * num_n
    result_denom = denom_x * denom_n
    
    # Check if the resulting fraction is a whole number
    return result_num % result_denom == 0
```

This function works as follows:
- It splits each input string by '/' to extract the numerator and denominator.
- It multiplies the numerators together and the denominators together to get the resulting fraction.
- Finally, it checks if the numerator of the resulting fraction is divisible by its denominator without a remainder. If so, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
