Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Implement the fib4 sequence with base cases:
   - fib4(0) = 0
   - fib4(1) = 0
   - fib4(2) = 2
   - fib4(3) = 0

2. For n ≥ 4: fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

3. Use iteration (not recursion) for efficiency

4. Verify with examples:
   - fib4(5) = fib4(4) + fib4(3) + fib4(2) + fib4(1) = 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 4 ✓
   - fib4(6) = fib4(5) + fib4(4) + fib4(3) + fib4(2) = 4 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 8 ✓
   - fib4(7) = fib4(6) + fib4(5) + fib4(4) + fib4(3) = 8 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 14 ✓

The iterative approach maintains a sliding window of the last 4 values and computes forward to position n.

```python
def fib4(n: int):
    """The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence.  Do not use recursion.
    >>> fib4(5)
    4
    >>> fib4(6)
    8
    >>> fib4(7)

    if n == 0:
