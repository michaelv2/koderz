Looking at this problem, I need to determine if three sides form a right-angled triangle.

**Reasoning:**
- By the Pythagorean theorem, a right-angled triangle has sides where a² + b² = c² (where c is the hypotenuse/longest side)
- Since we don't know which side is the hypotenuse, I need to check if any arrangement satisfies the theorem
- Alternatively, I can sort the sides and check if the sum of squares of the two smaller sides equals the square of the largest side

**Approach:**
1. Sort the three sides
2. Check if smallest² + middle² = largest²

```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2
```
