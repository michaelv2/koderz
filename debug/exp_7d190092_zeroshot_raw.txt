Let me reason through this problem:

1. I need to compare two arrays of equal length
2. For each position, I need to calculate how far off the guess was from the actual score
3. If they match (guess == score), return 0
4. If they don't match, return the absolute difference between them
5. Return an array of these differences

This is straightforward - for each pair of elements at the same index, I calculate the absolute difference.

```python
def compare(game, guess):
    return [abs(g - s) for g, s in zip(game, guess)]
```
