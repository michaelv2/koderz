 The problem can be solved by separating odd and even numbers from both lists. If there are enough even numbers in lst2 to replace all the odd numbers in lst1, we return "YES", otherwise, we return "NO".

Here is the Python function that implements this solution:

```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    # Separate odd and even numbers from both lists
    lst1_odd = [num for num in lst1 if num % 2 != 0]
    lst2_even = [num for num in lst2 if num % 2 == 0]

    # Check if there are enough even numbers in lst2 to replace all the odd numbers in lst1
    return "YES" if len(lst2_even) >= len(lst1_odd) else "NO"
```
