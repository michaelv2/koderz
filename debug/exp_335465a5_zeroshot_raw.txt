Looking at this problem, I need to extract the decimal part of a positive floating point number.

The problem asks to:
1. Take a positive floating point number
2. Decompose it into integer part and decimal part
3. Return only the decimal part

For example, with 3.5:
- Integer part: 3
- Decimal part: 0.5
- Return: 0.5

The simplest way to get the decimal part is to subtract the integer part from the original number. In Python, I can use `int()` to get the integer part or use the modulo operator with 1.

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5
    """
    return number - int(number)
```
