Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Extract values at even indices from the input list
2. Sort those values
3. Put the sorted values back at even indices
4. Keep odd indices unchanged

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[1, 2, 3]`: even indices are 0, 2 with values 1, 3. Sorted: 1, 3. So result is [1, 2, 3]
- `[5, 6, 3, 4]`: even indices are 0, 2 with values 5, 3. Sorted: 3, 5. So result is [3, 6, 5, 4]

```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
    [3, 6, 5, 4]
    """
    # Extract values at even indices
    even_values = [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 2)]
    
    # Sort the even values
    even_values.sort()
    
    # Create result list
    result = l.copy()
    
    # Put sorted even values back at even indices
    even_index = 0
    for i in range(0, len(result), 2):
        result[i] = even_values[even_index]
        even_index += 1
    
    return result
```
