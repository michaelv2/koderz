Let me break down the problem:

1. Given a positive integer N
2. Calculate the sum of its digits (in decimal)
3. Convert that sum to binary
4. Return the binary representation as a string

For example:
- N = 1000: digits are 1,0,0,0 → sum = 1 → binary = "1"
- N = 150: digits are 1,5,0 → sum = 6 → binary = "110"
- N = 147: digits are 1,4,7 → sum = 12 → binary = "1100"

The approach:
1. Convert N to a string to iterate through its digits
2. Sum up all the digits
3. Use Python's `bin()` function to convert to binary, which returns a string like "0b110"
4. Remove the "0b" prefix to get just the binary digits

```python
def solve(N):
    # Calculate sum of digits
    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(N))
    
    # Convert to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    return bin(digit_sum)[2:]
```
