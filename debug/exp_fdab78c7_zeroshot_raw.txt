To solve the problem of calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the mean (average) of the list.
2. Compute the absolute difference between each number and the mean.
3. Calculate the average of these absolute differences.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
- First, sum all the numbers in the list and divide by the count of numbers to get the mean.
- Then, iterate through the list again to compute the absolute difference between each number and the mean.
- Sum up all these absolute differences.
- Finally, divide this sum by the count of numbers to get the Mean Absolute Deviation.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    if not numbers:
        return 0.0
    
    # Step 1: Calculate the mean of the numbers
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the absolute differences from the mean
    absolute_differences = [abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the mean of these absolute differences
    mad = sum(absolute_differences) / len(numbers)
    
    return mad
```

This function handles an empty list by returning `0.0` as the MAD, which is a reasonable default since there are no elements to calculate deviation from.
