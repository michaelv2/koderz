```python
def get_positive(l):
    return [i for i in l if i > 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list and only includes it in the output list if it is greater than 0. This is a concise and efficient way of solving this problem, as it avoids having to manually loop through the list and check each number.
