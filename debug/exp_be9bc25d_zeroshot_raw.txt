Let me think through this problem:

1. I need to check if all three numbers are integers
2. I need to check if one of the numbers equals the sum of the other two
3. Return True only if both conditions are met

The three possible cases for the sum condition are:
- x = y + z
- y = x + z
- z = x + y

For checking if a number is an integer, I need to be careful because floats like 5.0 should be considered integers in some contexts, but the examples show that 3.6 returns False. I'll use `isinstance(x, int)` but also need to handle the case where someone passes a float that happens to be a whole number. Actually, looking at the examples, 3.6 is explicitly False, so I should reject any actual float type. Let me use `isinstance()` to check for int type specifically, which will reject floats even if they're whole numbers.

Wait, but I should also consider that in Python 3, `isinstance(5.0, int)` returns False. Let me check the logic: if we want to accept only true integers, I can use `isinstance(x, int)` and `isinstance(x, bool)` check (since bool is a subclass of int in Python). Actually, for this problem, the simplest approach is to check if each value is an instance of int and not a bool.

```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    # Check if all three are integers (not bools, not floats)
    if not (isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int)):
        return False
    if isinstance(x, bool) or isinstance(y, bool) or isinstance(z, bool):
        return False
    
    # Check if one of the numbers equals the sum of the other two
    if x == y + z or y == x + z or z == x + y:
        return True
    
    return False
```
