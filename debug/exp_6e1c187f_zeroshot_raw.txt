To solve this problem, we need to create a function that takes a string representing a number and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant from two integers, we should round it away from zero.

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement this:

1. Convert the input string to a floating-point number.
2. Check if the number is positive or negative.
3. For positive numbers:
   - If the fractional part is less than 0.5, round down.
   - If the fractional part is greater than or equal to 0.5, round up.
4. For negative numbers:
   - If the fractional part is less than -0.5, round down (which means moving further away from zero).
   - If the fractional part is greater than or equal to -0.5, round up (which means moving closer to zero).

This approach ensures that we round away from zero when the number is equidistant between two integers.

Here's the complete function implementation:

```python
def closest_integer(value):
    num = float(value)
    if num >= 0:
        return int(num + 0.5)
    else:
        return int(num - 0.5)
```

This code block contains the function `closest_integer` that implements the described logic to round numbers away from zero when they are equidistant between two integers.
