Let me reason through this problem:

1. I need to find a vowel that is between two consonants
2. The vowel must be searched from the right side of the word
3. Vowels at the beginning or end don't count
4. Return the closest vowel to the right that meets the condition
5. Case sensitive (both uppercase and lowercase vowels count)

My approach:
- Start from the right side of the word, but not from the very last character
- Move backwards looking for a vowel
- When I find a vowel, check if it has a consonant on its right and a consonant on its left
- Return the first (closest to right) vowel that satisfies this condition

Let me trace through the examples:
- "yogurt": checking from right... 't' is consonant, 'u' is vowel with 'r' (consonant) on right and 'g' (consonant) on left → return "u" ✓
- "FULL": checking from right... 'L' is consonant, 'L' is consonant, 'U' is vowel with 'L' (consonant) on right and 'F' (consonant) on left → return "U" ✓
- "quick": checking from right... 'k' consonant, 'c' consonant, 'i' vowel but needs consonant on right which is 'c' ✓ and left which is 'u' (vowel) ✗ → doesn't work. Continue... no valid vowel found ✓
- "ab": only 2 chars, can't have vowel between two consonants ✓

```python
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    
    # Start from right side, but not including the last character
    # We need at least one character to the right (consonant requirement)
    for i in range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1):  # range goes from len-2 down to 1 (not 0, since we need consonant on left)
        if word[i] in vowels:
            # Check if there's a consonant on the right and left
            if word[i - 1] not in vowels and word[i + 1] not in vowels:
                return word[i]
    
    return ""
