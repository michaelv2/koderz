Idea: sort the numbers and find the pair of adjacent elements with the smallest difference. If duplicates exist, this yields a pair with difference zero and early exit.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two numbers are required")
    
    nums = sorted(numbers)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    best_pair = (nums[0], nums[1])
    
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        a, b = nums[i], nums[i + 1]
        diff = b - a  # non-negative since nums is sorted
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            best_pair = (a, b)
            if diff == 0:
                break  # cannot do better than zero
    
    return best_pair
```
