Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Convert a decimal number to binary format
2. Wrap the binary result with "db" at the beginning and end
3. Return the result as a string

Let me trace through the examples:
- decimal_to_binary(15): 15 in binary is 1111, so return "db1111db"
- decimal_to_binary(32): 32 in binary is 100000, so return "db100000db"

I can use Python's built-in `bin()` function which converts a decimal to binary, but it returns a string with '0b' prefix. I need to remove that prefix and add the 'db' wrapper.

```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to
    binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary
    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.

    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.
    The extra characters are there to help with the format.

    Examples:
    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns "db1111db"
    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns "db100000db"
    """
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]  # Convert to binary and remove '0b' prefix
    return f"db{binary}db"
```
