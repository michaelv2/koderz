 The problem requires us to count the number of prime hexadecimal digits in a given string. Hexadecimal digits are 0-9 and A-F (where A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15). Prime numbers among these are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Here's my plan:
1. Define a set of prime hexadecimal digits for easy lookup.
2. Iterate over each character in the input string.
3. If the character is in the set of prime hexadecimal digits, increment a counter.
4. Return the counter at the end.

Now I'll write and execute the Python function.
```python
def hex_key(num):
    primes = {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}
    count = 0
    for digit in num:
        if digit in primes:
            count += 1
    return count
```
The function `hex_key(num)` has been successfully defined. It takes a hexadecimal number as input, represented as a string, and returns the count of prime hexadecimal digits in that number. The prime hexadecimal digits are '2', '3', '5', '7', 'B' (which represents 11), and 'D' (which represents 13).

Now you can use this function to solve the problem as described.
