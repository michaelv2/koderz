To solve this problem, we need to extract the decimal part of a given positive floating point number. The integer part can be obtained using the `int()` function, and the decimal part can be found by subtracting the integer part from the original number.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    an integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5
    """
    return number - int(number)
```
