 The problem requires calculating the average of integers from n to m (inclusive), rounding it to the nearest integer, and converting that to binary. If n is greater than m, return -1.

Here's how I plan to solve this:
1. Check if n > m. If true, return -1.
2. Calculate the average of integers from n to m (inclusive) by summing them and dividing by the count.
3. Round the average to the nearest integer using the built-in round function.
4. Convert the rounded average to binary using the bin function, which returns a string starting with "0b".
5. Return the binary string.

Now I'll write the Python code for this plan.
```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if n > m:
        return -1
    avg = round((n + m) / 2)
    return bin(avg)
```
