Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Parse a string containing musical notes separated by spaces
2. Map each note symbol to its beat value:
   - 'o' → 4 beats
   - 'o|' → 2 beats
   - '.|' → 1 beat
3. Return a list of integers representing the beats

The approach is straightforward:
- Split the input string by spaces to get individual note symbols
- Create a mapping dictionary for note symbols to beat values
- Convert each note symbol to its corresponding beat value
- Return the resulting list

```python
def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    note_to_beats = {
        'o': 4,
        'o|': 2,
        '.|': 1
    }
    
    notes = music_string.split()
    return [note_to_beats[note] for note in notes]
```
