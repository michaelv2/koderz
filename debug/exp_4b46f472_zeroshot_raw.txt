Let me reason through this problem:

1. I need to find all even digits between a and b (inclusive)
2. Even digits are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
3. The function should work regardless of which number is larger (a or b)
4. Return results in ascending order
5. If there are no even digits in the range, return an empty list

My approach:
- Handle the case where a > b by swapping them
- Iterate through all single digits (0-9)
- Check if each digit is even (digit % 2 == 0)
- Check if the digit falls within the range [a, b]
- Return the filtered list

```python
def generate_integers(a, b):
    # Ensure a <= b
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    
    # Even digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
    # Return those that fall within the range [a, b]
    return [digit for digit in range(0, 10) if digit % 2 == 0 and a <= digit <= b]
```
