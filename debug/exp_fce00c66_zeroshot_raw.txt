 The problem is about finding the derivative of a polynomial given its coefficients. To solve this, we can iterate through the list of coefficients and multiply each coefficient by its index (since the derivative of x^n is n*x^(n-1)), then return a new list containing these results starting from the first non-zero derivative.

Here's my plan:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the derivatives.
2. Iterate through each coefficient in the input list, starting from index 1 (since the derivative of a constant is 0).
3. Multiply the current coefficient by its index and append it to the derivatives list.
4. Return the derivatives list.

Now I'll write the Python function that implements this plan.
```python
def derivative(xs: list):
    return [i * x for i, x in enumerate(xs) if i > 0]
```
