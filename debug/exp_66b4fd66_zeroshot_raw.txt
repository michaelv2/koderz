Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Create a function that takes a list of integers
2. Calculate the sum of all integers in the list
3. Calculate the product of all integers in the list
4. Return both values as a tuple
5. Handle the empty list case where sum = 0 and product = 1

Let me trace through the examples:
- For empty list `[]`: return (0, 1)
- For `[1, 2, 3, 4]`: sum = 1+2+3+4 = 10, product = 1×2×3×4 = 24, return (10, 24)

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    if not numbers:
        return (0, 1)
    
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    
    return (total_sum, product)
```
