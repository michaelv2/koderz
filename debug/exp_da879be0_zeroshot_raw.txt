Looking at this problem, I need to check if two words have the same characters (regardless of order or frequency).

The key insight is that two words have the "same characters" if they contain exactly the same set of unique characters. For example:
- 'eabcdzzzz' has characters {e, a, b, c, d, z}
- 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc' has characters {d, z, e, a, b, c}
- These are the same set, so return True

- 'eabcd' has characters {e, a, b, c, d}
- 'dddddddabc' has characters {d, a, b, c} (missing 'e')
- These are different sets, so return False

The solution is to convert each string to a set of its characters and compare them for equality.

```python
def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):
    """
    Check if two words have the same characters.
    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc')
    True
    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc')
    True
    >>> same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd')
    True
    >>> same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc')
    False
    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce')
    False
    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc')
    False
    """
    return set(s0) == set(s1)
```
