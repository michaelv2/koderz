 The problem is about finding the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. To solve this, we can find the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome and append to the end of the string the reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.

Here's how I plan to implement the solution:
1. Define a helper function `is_palindrome` to check if a given string is a palindrome.
2. In the main function `make_palindrome`, iterate through the input string from the end to the beginning, checking if each substring is a palindrome using the helper function.
3. If a palindrome is found, append the reverse of the remaining prefix to the input string and return the result.
4. If no palindrome is found (which means the entire input string is not a palindrome), append the reverse of the input string to itself and return the result.

Now I'll write the Python code for this solution.
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """Test if given string is a palindrome"""
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string"""
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if is_palindrome(string[i:]):
            return string + string[:i][::-1]
    return string + string[::-1]
```
