To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the list and sum up the even elements that are located at odd indices. Here's how we can approach it:

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum.
2. Iterate through the list using a loop, keeping track of the index.
3. Check if the current index is odd and if the element at this index is even.
4. If both conditions are met, add the element to the sum.
5. Return the sum after the loop completes.

```python
def add(lst):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            total += lst[i]
    return total
```
