I need to implement a function that returns the prime factorization of a given integer.

Let me think through this step by step:

1. I need to find all prime factors of the input number `n`
2. Each factor should appear as many times as it divides `n`
3. The factors should be returned in ascending order
4. The product of all returned factors should equal the original number

My approach:
- Start with the smallest prime number (2)
- While the current number is greater than 1:
  - If it's divisible by the current factor, add that factor to the result and divide the number
  - If not divisible, move to the next potential factor
- Continue until the number becomes 1

Let me trace through the examples:
- factorize(8): 8÷2=4, 4÷2=2, 2÷2=1 → [2, 2, 2]
- factorize(25): 25÷5=5, 5÷5=1 → [5, 5]
- factorize(70): 70÷2=35, 35÷5=7, 7÷7=1 → [2, 5, 7]

```python
def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    divisor = 2
    
    while n > 1:
        while n % divisor == 0:
            factors.append(divisor)
            n //= divisor
        divisor += 1
    
    return factors
```
