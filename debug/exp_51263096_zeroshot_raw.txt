Looking at this problem, I need to determine if a list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

Let me think through the approach:
1. A list is monotonic if it's either entirely non-decreasing (each element >= previous) or entirely non-increasing (each element <= previous)
2. I need to check both conditions
3. I can iterate through the list once and track whether it's increasing, decreasing, or both

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[1, 2, 4, 20]`: Each element >= previous → increasing → True
- `[1, 20, 4, 10]`: 1→20 (increasing), then 20→4 (decreasing) → False  
- `[4, 1, 0, -10]`: Each element <= previous → decreasing → True

I'll use a single pass approach:
- Track if we've seen increasing or decreasing relationships
- If we see both, return False
- If we only see one type (or none), return True

```python
def monotonic(l: list):
    if len(l) <= 1:
        return True
    
    increasing = None
    
    for i in range(1, len(l)):
        if l[i] > l[i-1]:
            if increasing is False:
                return False
            increasing = True
        elif l[i] < l[i-1]:
            if increasing is True:
                return False
            increasing = False
        # If l[i] == l[i-1], we continue without changing the trend
    
    return True
```
