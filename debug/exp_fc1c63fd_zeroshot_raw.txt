To solve the problem of finding a zero of a polynomial with an even number of coefficients, we can use numerical methods. Given that the polynomial has an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient guarantees a solution, we can apply the Newton-Raphson method for finding roots.

The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative technique used to find successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. The formula for the method is:

\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \]

Where:
- \( f(x) \) is the polynomial.
- \( f'(x) \) is the derivative of the polynomial.

First, we need to implement a function to compute the value of the polynomial and its derivative. Then, we can apply the Newton-Raphson method iteratively until the change in \( x \) is smaller than a specified tolerance level.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum(coeff * (x ** i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs))

def poly_derivative(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates the derivative of polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    """
    return sum(i * coeff * (x ** (i - 1)) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs) if i > 0)

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """ 
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero finds x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.
    """
    # Initial guess can be 0 or any other value
    x = 0.0
    tolerance = 1e-7
    max_iterations = 1000
    
    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        fx = poly(xs, x)
        fpx = poly_derivative(xs, x)
        
        if abs(fx) < tolerance:
            return x
        
        if fpx == 0:
            raise ValueError("Derivative is zero. No solution found.")
        
        x_new = x - fx / fpx
        if abs(x_new - x) < tolerance:
            return x_new
        
        x = x_new
    
    raise RuntimeError("Failed to converge to a solution.")

```

This code defines the `poly` function to evaluate the polynomial, the `poly_derivative` function to compute its derivative, and the `find_zero` function that uses the Newton-Raphson method to find a root of the polynomial. The method iterates until the change in \( x \) is smaller than a specified tolerance or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
