 The problem requires us to determine whether a given number `x` can be expressed as the power of another number `n`. To solve this, we will iterate through all possible integer powers of `n` and check if any of them equals `x`. If such a power is found, we return True; otherwise, we return False.

Here's my plan:
1. Initialize a variable `power` to 0.
2. Start a loop that continues until the condition `n**power <= x` is satisfied.
3. Inside the loop, check if `n**power == x`. If true, return True.
4. Increment `power` by 1 at the end of each iteration.
5. If the loop ends without finding a match, return False.

Now I'll implement this in Python:

```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    power = 0
    while n**power <= x:
        if n**power == x:
            return True
        power += 1
    return False
```
