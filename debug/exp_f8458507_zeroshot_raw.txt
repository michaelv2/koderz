To determine if a list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, we can check two conditions:
1. The list should either be entirely non-decreasing (each element is less than or equal to the next).
2. Or, the list should be entirely non-increasing (each element is greater than or equal to the next).

We can implement this by iterating through the list and checking these conditions.

```python
def monotonic(l: list):
    increasing = decreasing = True
    
    for i in range(1, len(l)):
        if l[i] > l[i - 1]:
            decreasing = False
        elif l[i] < l[i - 1]:
            increasing = False
    
    return increasing or decreasing
```
