To solve this problem, we need to create a new list where the elements at even indices are sorted, while the elements at odd indices remain unchanged. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Extract the elements at even indices from the original list.
2. Sort these extracted elements.
3. Reconstruct the new list by placing the sorted elements back at their respective even indices and keeping the odd-indexed elements as they are.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    # Extract elements at even indices
    even_elements = [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 2)]
    
    # Sort the extracted even elements
    even_elements.sort()
    
    # Reconstruct the new list with sorted even elements and unchanged odd elements
    result = []
    even_index = 0
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(even_elements[even_index])
            even_index += 1
        else:
            result.append(l[i])
    
    return result
```

This function first extracts the elements at even indices and sorts them. Then, it iterates through the original list, reconstructing the new list by placing the sorted even elements back in their respective positions while keeping the odd-indexed elements unchanged.
