To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Identify prime numbers from the given list.
2. Find the largest prime number among them.
3. Compute the sum of the digits of this largest prime number.

Here's how I plan to implement it:
- Create a helper function to check if a number is prime.
- Iterate through the list to find all prime numbers and keep track of the largest one.
- Once the largest prime is identified, calculate the sum of its digits.

Let's write the code:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def skjkasdkd(lst):
    """Find the largest prime in the list and return the sum of its digits."""
    largest_prime = None
    for num in lst:
        if is_prime(num):
            if largest_prime is None or num > largest_prime:
                largest_prime = num
    
    if largest_prime is not None:
        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(largest_prime))
    else:
        return 0

```
