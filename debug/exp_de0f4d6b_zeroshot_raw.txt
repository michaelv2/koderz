I need to find the two closest numbers in a list and return them in order (smaller, larger).

Let me think through the approach:
1. I need to compare every pair of numbers in the list
2. Calculate the absolute difference between each pair
3. Find the pair with the minimum difference
4. Return that pair in order (smaller number first)

I'll use a nested loop approach to check all pairs, or I can sort the list first and then only check adjacent elements, which would be more efficient.

Let me go with the sorting approach since it's more efficient:
- Sort the list
- Check adjacent elements for minimum difference
- Return the pair in the required order

```python
from typing import List, Tuple


def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    # Sort the numbers
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    
    # Initialize minimum difference and the closest pair
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = None
    
    # Check adjacent elements in the sorted list
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        diff = sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[i], sorted_numbers[i + 1])
    
    return closest_pair
```
