To solve this problem, we need to construct an algebraic expression using the provided operators and operands, and then evaluate it. The key steps are:

1. Iterate through the list of operators.
2. For each operator, combine it with the corresponding operands from the operand list.
3. Use Python's `eval` function to evaluate the constructed expression.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    # Initialize the expression with the first operand
    expression = str(operand[0])
    
    # Iterate through the operators and operands to build the expression
    for i in range(len(operator)):
        expression += f" {operator[i]} {operand[i + 1]}"
    
    # Evaluate the constructed expression
    result = eval(expression)
    return result
```

This function constructs a string representing the algebraic expression by iterating through the operators and operands, then evaluates it using Python's `eval` function.
