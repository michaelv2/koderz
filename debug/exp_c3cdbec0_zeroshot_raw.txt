Looking at this problem, I need to validate a filename based on several specific conditions. Let me break down what I need to check:

1. No more than three digits in the filename
2. Exactly one dot in the filename
3. The part before the dot is not empty and starts with a letter
4. The part after the dot is one of ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']

Let me trace through the examples:
- "example.txt" - valid: 1 digit, 1 dot, starts with letter, ends with 'txt' ✓
- "1example.dll" - invalid: starts with digit, not letter ✗

```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    # Check if there's exactly one dot
    if file_name.count('.') != 1:
        return 'No'
    
    # Split into name and extension
    name_part, extension = file_name.split('.')
    
    # Check if extension is valid
    if extension not in ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']:
        return 'No'
    
    # Check if name part is not empty
    if not name_part:
        return 'No'
    
    # Check if name part starts with a letter
    if not name_part[0].isalpha():
        return 'No'
    
    # Count digits in the entire filename
    digit_count = sum(1 for char in file_name if char.isdigit())
    if digit_count > 3:
        return 'No'
    
    return 'Yes'
```
