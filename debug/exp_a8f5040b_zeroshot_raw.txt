To solve this problem, we need to find the common elements between two lists, ensure they are unique, and return them sorted. Here's how I plan to achieve this:

1. Convert both lists to sets to remove any duplicate elements.
2. Find the intersection of these two sets to get the common elements.
3. Convert the resulting set back to a list.
4. Sort the list before returning it.

This approach ensures that we only keep unique elements and that they are returned in sorted order.

```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    return sorted(set(l1) & set(l2))
```
