Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Start with n stones in the first level
2. For each subsequent level, I need to determine whether to add the next odd or even number
3. The rule is: if n is odd, use next odd numbers; if n is even, use next even numbers
4. Return a list with n elements, where each element represents stones in that level

Let me trace through the example:
- n = 3 (odd)
- Level 1: 3 stones
- Next odd number after 3 is 5
- Next odd number after 5 is 7
- Result: [3, 5, 7]

For n = 4 (even):
- Level 1: 4 stones
- Next even number after 4 is 6
- Next even number after 6 is 8
- Result: [4, 6, 8, 10]

The pattern is:
- Start with n
- Keep adding the same increment (2 for odd, 2 for even) to get the next number
- Generate n numbers total

```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    """
    result = []
    current = n
    increment = 2  # Both odd and even numbers increase by 2
    
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(current)
        current += increment
    
    return result
```
