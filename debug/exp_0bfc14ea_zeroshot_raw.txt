 The problem is about writing a Python function that takes a string as input and returns an ordered version of it. In the ordered version, all words (separated by space) are replaced with a new word where all the characters are arranged in ascending order based on their ASCII value. The order of words and blank spaces should be preserved in the sentence.

Here's how I plan to solve this problem:
1. Split the input string into a list of words using the `split()` function.
2. For each word in the list, sort its characters in ascending order based on their ASCII value using the `sorted()` function.
3. Join the sorted characters back into a word using the `join()` function.
4. Join all the words back into a sentence with spaces using the `join()` function.
5. Return the ordered version of the input string.

Here's my solution:
```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    return ' '.join(''.join(sorted(word)) for word in s.split())
```
