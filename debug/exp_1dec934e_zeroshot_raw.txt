To solve this problem, we need to parse through the input string and identify top-level balanced groups of parentheses while ignoring spaces. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - We'll use a list `result` to store the final balanced groups.
   - A variable `current_group` will accumulate characters for the current group being processed.
   - An integer `balance` will keep track of the nesting level of parentheses.

2. **Iterate Through Characters**:
   - Loop through each character in the input string.
   - Ignore spaces as they are not relevant to the grouping of parentheses.

3. **Track Parentheses**:
   - When encountering an opening parenthesis `(`, increase the `balance` and add it to `current_group`.
   - When encountering a closing parenthesis `)`, decrease the `balance` and add it to `current_group`.

4. **Detect Top-Level Groups**:
   - A top-level group is completed when `balance` returns to 0 after being incremented.
   - At this point, append `current_group` to `result` and reset `current_group` for the next potential group.

5. **Return Result**:
   - After processing all characters, return the list of balanced groups stored in `result`.

Here's the implementation based on the above logic:

```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    result = []
    current_group = []
    balance = 0
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == ' ':
            continue
        elif char == '(':
            balance += 1
            current_group.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1
            current_group.append(char)
            
            # If balance is zero, we have a complete top-level group
            if balance == 0:
                result.append(''.join(current_group))
                current_group = []
    
    return result
```

This function will correctly identify and separate each top-level balanced group of parentheses from the input string, ignoring spaces as specified.
