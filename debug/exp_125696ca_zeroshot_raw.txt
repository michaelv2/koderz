My reasoning:
- I need to return a tuple with two values: sum and product
- For an empty list: sum should be 0, product should be 1
- For a non-empty list: calculate the sum of all elements and product of all elements
- I can use Python's built-in `sum()` function for the sum
- For the product, I can use `math.prod()` (Python 3.8+) or manually multiply elements

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import math

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    total_product = math.prod(numbers)
    return (total_sum, total_product)
```
