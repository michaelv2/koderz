 The problem is about parsing a string representing musical notes in a special ASCII format and returning a list of integers corresponding to how many beats does each note last. To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and check for each possible note representation ('o', 'o|', '.|') while keeping track of the current index. Depending on which note is found, we append the corresponding number of beats to the output list and update the current index accordingly.

Here's the Python function that implements this solution:

```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    beats = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(music_string):
        if music_string[i] == 'o':
            beats.append(4)
            i += 1
            if i < len(music_string) and music_string[i] == '|':
                i += 1
        elif music_string[i:i+2] == '.|':
            beats.append(1)
            i += 2
        elif music_string[i:i+2] == 'o|':
            beats.append(2)
            i += 2
    return beats
```
