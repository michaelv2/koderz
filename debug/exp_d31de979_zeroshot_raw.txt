Let me reason through this problem:

1. We need to alternate between picking the minimum and maximum values from a list
2. Start with the minimum, then take the maximum of what remains, then minimum, and so on
3. We need to handle the ordering correctly

Approach:
- Sort the list
- Use two pointers: one at the start (for minimums) and one at the end (for maximums)
- Alternate between taking from the start and end
- When start pointer goes past end pointer, we're done

Let me trace through an example:
- `[1, 2, 3, 4]` sorted is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- Take min (left=0): 1, left becomes 1
- Take max (right=3): 4, right becomes 2
- Take min (left=1): 2, left becomes 2
- Take max (right=2): 3, right becomes 1
- Result: `[1, 4, 2, 3]` ✓

```python
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    result = []
    left = 0
    right = len(sorted_lst) - 1
    take_min = True
    
    while left <= right:
        if take_min:
            result.append(sorted_lst[left])
            left += 1
        else:
            result.append(sorted_lst[right])
            right -= 1
        take_min = not take_min
    
    return result
```
