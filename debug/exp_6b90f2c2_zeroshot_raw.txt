Let me analyze this problem:

1. Iterate through the list with indices
2. For each element:
   - If index is a multiple of 3: square the element
   - Else if index is a multiple of 4 (and not 3): cube the element
   - Otherwise: keep the element unchanged
3. Return the sum of all modified elements

Let me trace through an example:
- `lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]` with indices [0,1,2,3,4]
  - Index 0: multiple of 3 → (-1)² = 1
  - Index 1: not multiple of 3 or 4 → -5
  - Index 2: not multiple of 3 or 4 → 2
  - Index 3: not multiple of 3, but is it multiple of 4? No → -1
  - Index 4: multiple of 4 and not 3 → (-5)³ = -125
  - Sum: 1 + (-5) + 2 + (-1) + (-125) = -128

Wait, the expected output is -126. Let me reconsider the logic. Looking at the problem again: "if its index is a multiple of 3" - index 0 is a multiple of 3 (0 % 3 == 0), and "multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3" - index 4 is a multiple of 4 (4 % 4 == 0) and not of 3.

Actually, let me recalculate: 1 - 5 + 2 - 1 - 125 = -128. But expected is -126. Let me check if perhaps index 0 shouldn't be treated as multiple of 3. Actually, 0 IS a multiple of 3, so index 0 should be squared. But maybe the problem means positive multiples? Let me assume indices starting from 1 or reconsider...

Actually, re-reading: perhaps index 0 is NOT considered for the operations? Let me try: indices [1,2,3,4,5] for elements:
- Index 1: not multiple of 3 or 4 → -1
- Index 2: not multiple of 3 or 4 → -5
- Index 3: multiple of 3 → 2² = 4
- Index 4: multiple of 4 and not 3 → (-1)³ = -1
- Index 5: not multiple of 3 or 4 → -5
Sum: -1 - 5 + 4 - 1 - 5 = -8 (still wrong)

Let me try the original indexing starting at 0 but treating 0 as "not a multiple":
- Index 0: -1 (unchanged)
- Index 1: -5 (unchanged)
- Index 2: 2 (unchanged)
- Index 3: multiple of 3 → (-1)² = 1
- Index 4: multiple of 4, not 3 → (-5)³ = -125
Sum: -1 - 5 + 2 + 1 - 125 = -128 (still -128)

Hmm, let me check if index 4 should be cubed or if -125 is actually correct... -5 * -5 * -5 = -125. The expected answer must be checking something different. Let me implement as stated:

```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    result = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result += num ** 2
        elif i % 4 == 0:
            result += num ** 3
        else:
            result += num
    return result
```
