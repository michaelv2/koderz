Looking at this problem, I need to find if there exist three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

My approach:
1. Check if the list has at least 3 elements (necessary condition)
2. Use a three-pointer or brute force approach to find three elements that sum to zero
3. For efficiency with reasonable list sizes, I can use a set-based approach:
   - For each pair of elements, check if the negative of their sum exists in the list
   - Make sure we're using three distinct elements (distinct by value or by index)

Let me trace through an example:
- `[1, 3, -2, 1]`: We need three elements summing to 0. Check: 1 + (-2) + 1 = 0. But are these distinct elements? The two 1's are at different indices, so they're distinct by position. The problem says "distinct elements" which I interpret as different positions/indices.

Actually, looking more carefully at the examples, I think "distinct elements" means different indices/positions, not necessarily different values.

I'll use a brute force O(n³) approach for clarity, or optimize to O(n²) using a set:

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
    n = len(l)
    
    # Need at least 3 elements
    if n < 3:
        return False
    
    # Check all combinations of three distinct indices
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            for k in range(j + 1, n):
                if l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0:
                    return True
    
    return False
```
