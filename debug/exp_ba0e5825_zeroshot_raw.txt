Looking at this problem, I need to determine when a number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.

Let me think about the constraints:
- 4 positive even numbers: each must be ≥ 2
- The minimum sum would be 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8
- So any number less than 8 cannot be expressed as such a sum
- For numbers ≥ 8, I need to check if they can be decomposed into 4 positive even numbers

Let me verify the examples:
- n = 4: Cannot be written as sum of 4 positive even numbers (minimum is 8) → False
- n = 6: Cannot be written as sum of 4 positive even numbers (minimum is 8) → False  
- n = 8: Can be written as 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 → True

For any even number n ≥ 8, I can always write it as the sum of 4 positive even numbers. Here's why:
- If n = 8, then 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8
- If n > 8, I can write n = 2 + 2 + 2 + (n-6), where (n-6) is even and ≥ 2, so it's a valid positive even number

For odd numbers, it's impossible since the sum of even numbers is always even.

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
    Example
    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    """
    return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0
```
