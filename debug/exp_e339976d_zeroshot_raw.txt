 The problem is about creating a Python function that takes a string as input and returns a list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string. To solve this problem, we can use a loop to iterate through each character in the string and append it to a result list.

Here's the complete function implementation:

```python
from typing import List

def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    prefixes = []
    for i in range(1, len(string) + 1):
        prefixes.append(string[:i])
    return prefixes
```
