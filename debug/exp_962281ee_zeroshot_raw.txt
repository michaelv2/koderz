 The problem is about writing a Python function that takes an array of integers and returns the number of elements which have a sum of digits greater than 0. If a number is negative, its first signed digit will be negative.

Here's how I plan to solve this:
1. Define a helper function `sum_of_digits` that calculates the sum of absolute values of digits in an integer.
2. Iterate over each element in the input array and check if the sum of its digits is greater than 0 using the `sum_of_digits` function.
3. Count the number of elements that satisfy this condition and return it as the result.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
def count_nums(arr):
    def sum_of_digits(n):
        return sum(int(d) for d in str(abs(n)))

    return sum(1 for num in arr if sum_of_digits(num) > 0)
```
