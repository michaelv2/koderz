Let me think through this step by step.

1. First, I need to find the intersection of two intervals
2. Then calculate the length of that intersection
3. Check if that length is a prime number
4. Return "YES" if prime, "NO" otherwise

For finding intersection of intervals (a,b) and (c,d):
- The intersection starts at max(a,c) 
- The intersection ends at min(b,d)
- If max(a,c) > min(b,d), then there's no intersection

For the length calculation:
- Length = end - start + 1 (since intervals are closed)
- If no intersection, length = 0

For prime checking:
- Length 0 and 1 are not prime
- Length 2 is prime
- For length > 2, check if it's divisible by any number from 2 to sqrt(length)

Let me trace through the examples:
1. (1,2) and (2,3): intersection is (2,2), length = 1, not prime → "NO"
2. (-1,1) and (0,4): intersection is (0,1), length = 2, prime → "NO" (wait, this should be "NO" according to example)
3. (-3,-1) and (-5,5): intersection is (-3,-1), length = 3, prime → "YES"

Wait, let me recheck example 2:
(-1,1) and (0,4): intersection starts at max(-1,0) = 0, ends at min(1,4) = 1
So intersection is (0,1), length = 1-0+1 = 2, which is prime
But the expected output is "NO", so I must have misunderstood something.

Let me re-read... the intervals are closed, so (0,1) includes both 0 and 1, so length = 1-0+1 = 2.
But wait, if we're talking about the "length" of the interval, that's the number of integers in it.
For (0,1), the integers are {0,1}, so that's 2 integers, so length = 2.

Actually, let me reconsider what "length" means in this context. Looking at the example:
"the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3) which its length is 1"

(2,3) includes integers 2 and 3, so that's 2 integers. But they say length is 1.
I think "length" here means the mathematical length = end - start, not the count of integers.

So for (2,3), length = 3-2 = 1. That makes sense.

Let me recheck:
1. (1,2) and (2,3): intersection is (2,2), length = 2-2 = 0, not prime → "NO" ✓
2. (-1,1) and (0,4): intersection is (0,1), length = 1-0 = 1, not prime → "NO" ✓  
3. (-3,-1) and (-5,5): intersection is (-3,-1), length = -1-(-3) = 2, prime → "YES" ✓

```python
def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """You are given two intervals,
    where each interval is a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).
    The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)
    includes both start and end.
    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.
    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two 
    intervals is a prime number.
    Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
    which its length is 1, which not a prime number.
    If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES",
    otherwise, return "NO".
    If the two intervals don't intersect, return "NO".


    [input/output] samples:
    intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> "YES"
    """
    start1, end1 = interval1
    start2, end2 = interval2
    
    # Find intersection
    intersection_start = max(start1, start2)
    intersection_end = min(end1, end2)
    
    # Check if there's an intersection
    if intersection_start > intersection_end:
        return "NO"
    
    # Calculate length of intersection
    length = intersection_end - intersection_start
    
    # Check if length is prime
    if length < 2:
        return "NO"
    
    # Check for prime
    for i in range(2, int(length**0.5) + 1):
        if length % i == 0:
            return "NO"
    
    return "YES"
