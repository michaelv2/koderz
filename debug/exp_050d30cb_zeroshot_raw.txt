Let me reason through this problem:

1. I need to check two conditions for the object to fly:
   - The list must be palindromic (balanced) - reads the same forwards and backwards
   - The sum of elements must be <= the maximum weight w

2. A palindromic list means `q == q[::-1]`

3. I need to check if `sum(q) <= w`

4. Both conditions must be True for the function to return True

```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w
```
