Looking at this problem, I need to find the largest prime factor of a given number n.

Let me think through the approach:
1. Since n is guaranteed to be > 1 and not prime, it has prime factors
2. I need to find all prime factors and return the largest one
3. A efficient approach is to divide n by the smallest possible prime factors first
4. Start with 2, then check odd numbers starting from 3
5. Keep dividing n by each factor found until n becomes 1
6. The last factor found will be the largest prime factor

Let me trace through the examples:
- For 13195: 13195 = 5 × 2639 = 5 × 7 × 377 = 5 × 7 × 13 × 29. The largest is 29.
- For 2048: 2048 = 2^11. The largest prime factor is 2.

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n: int):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.
    >>> largest_prime_factor(13195)
    29
    >>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
    2
    """
    largest_factor = 1
    divisor = 2
    
    while divisor * divisor <= n:
        while n % divisor == 0:
            largest_factor = divisor
            n = n // divisor
        divisor += 1
    
    if n > 1:
        largest_factor = n
    
    return largest_factor
```
