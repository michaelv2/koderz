To solve this problem, we need to find the second smallest unique element in a list of integers. If the list is empty or does not contain at least two unique elements, we should return `None`.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates.
2. Check if the length of the set is less than 2. If it is, return `None` because there aren't enough unique elements.
3. Otherwise, convert the set back to a sorted list and return the second element.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    unique_elements = set(lst)
    if len(unique_elements) < 2:
        return None
    sorted_unique_elements = sorted(unique_elements)
    return sorted_unique_elements[1]
```
