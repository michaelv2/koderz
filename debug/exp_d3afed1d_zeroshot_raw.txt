To solve the problem of finding the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the longest palindromic suffix of the given string.
2. Reverse the prefix of the string that precedes this palindromic suffix and append it to the end of the original string.

Here's the implementation of the `make_palindrome` function:

```python
def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. """
    n = len(string)
    for i in range(n, -1, -1):
        if is_palindrome(string[:i]):
            prefix_to_reverse = string[i:]
            return string + prefix_to_reverse[::-1]
    return string
```

This function works as follows:
- It iterates from the end of the string to the beginning.
- For each position `i`, it checks if the substring from the start to `i` is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function.
- Once it finds the longest palindromic suffix, it calculates the prefix that needs to be reversed and appends it to the original string to form the shortest palindrome.

This approach ensures that we find the shortest palindrome starting with the given string efficiently.
