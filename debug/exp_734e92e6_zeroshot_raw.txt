To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Iterate through each number in the input list.
2. Check if the number is greater than 10.
3. Extract the first and last digits of the number.
4. Check if both the first and last digits are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
5. Count how many numbers meet all these criteria.

Here's the Python function to achieve this:

```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            str_num = str(abs(num))  # Convert number to string and handle negative numbers
            first_digit = int(str_num[0])
            last_digit = int(str_num[-1])
            if first_digit % 2 != 0 and last_digit % 2 != 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

This function iterates through each number in the input list, checks the conditions, and counts the numbers that meet all the criteria.
