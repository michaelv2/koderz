```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    # If the array is empty, return None
    if not arr:
        return None
    
    product = 1
    sum_magnitudes = 0
    
    for num in arr:
        # Calculate the sign of each number and multiply it with the current product
        product *= -1 if num < 0 else 1
        
        # Add the magnitude of each number to the sum of magnitudes
        sum_magnitudes += abs(num)
    
    return product * sum_magnitudes
```
This function works by iterating over each element in the array. For each element, it calculates its sign and multiplies the current product with this sign. It also adds the absolute value of the number to a running total for the sum of magnitudes. The final result is the product of these two values.
