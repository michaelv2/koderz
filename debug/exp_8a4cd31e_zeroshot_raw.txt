To solve this problem, we need to ensure that every opening bracket `(` has a corresponding closing bracket `)` and that they are correctly nested. A common approach to solving such problems is using a counter or a stack. Here, I'll use a simple counter to keep track of the balance between opening and closing brackets.

The logic is as follows:
1. Initialize a counter to zero.
2. Traverse each character in the string:
   - Increment the counter for every `(` encountered.
   - Decrement the counter for every `)` encountered.
   - If at any point the counter becomes negative, it means there's a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket, so we return `False`.
3. After processing all characters, if the counter is zero, it means all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

This approach ensures that the brackets are not only balanced but also correctly nested.

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1
        # If balance is negative, there are more closing brackets than opening ones
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    # If balance is zero, all opening brackets have been matched
    return balance == 0
```
