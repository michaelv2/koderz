Let me break down this problem:

1. We start with `number` carrots already eaten
2. We need to eat `need` more carrots
3. We have `remaining` carrots available
4. We eat the minimum of `need` and `remaining` carrots
5. Return [total eaten, carrots left]

The logic:
- Carrots eaten today = min(need, remaining) - we eat what we can
- Total eaten = number + carrots eaten today
- Carrots left = remaining - carrots eaten today

Let me trace through an example:
- eat(5, 6, 10): We have 5 eaten, need 6 more, 10 available
  - We can eat min(6, 10) = 6 carrots
  - Total: 5 + 6 = 11
  - Left: 10 - 6 = 4
  - Result: [11, 4] ✓

- eat(2, 11, 5): We have 2 eaten, need 11 more, 5 available
  - We can eat min(11, 5) = 5 carrots
  - Total: 2 + 5 = 7
  - Left: 5 - 5 = 0
  - Result: [7, 0] ✓

```python
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    carrots_eaten_today = min(need, remaining)
    total_eaten = number + carrots_eaten_today
    carrots_left = remaining - carrots_eaten_today
    return [total_eaten, carrots_left]
```
