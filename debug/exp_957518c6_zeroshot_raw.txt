To solve this problem, we need to create a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that is the result of concatenating all the strings in the list. If the list is empty, the function should return an empty string.

The `str.join()` method in Python is well-suited for this task because it efficiently concatenates a list of strings into a single string with a specified separator. In this case, we want to use an empty string as the separator so that the strings are concatenated directly without any additional characters between them.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    return ''.join(strings)
```
