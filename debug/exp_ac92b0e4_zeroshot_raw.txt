 The problem is about filtering words from a given string that contain exactly 'n' consonants. To solve this, we can split the string into words and for each word, count the number of consonants. If the count matches 'n', we add the word to our result list.

Here is the Python function that implements this:

```python
def select_words(s, n):
    # Define a set of vowels for easy lookup
    vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}

    # Split the string into words
    words = s.split()

    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []

    # Iterate over each word in the list of words
    for word in words:
        # Count the number of consonants in the current word
        consonant_count = sum(1 for char in word if char.lower() not in vowels)

        # If the count matches 'n', add the word to the result list
        if consonant_count == n:
            result.append(word)

    return result
```
