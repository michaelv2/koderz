 The problem is about finding all prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`. To solve this, we can iterate through each number from 2 to `n`, check if it's a prime number by checking for divisibility with all numbers less than itself and greater than 1, and then add it to the result list if it is.

Here's how I plan to implement this in Python:

1. Define a helper function `is_prime` that takes an integer as input and returns True if it's prime, False otherwise. This function will iterate from 2 to the square root of the number (since a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked) and return False if the number is divisible by any of these.
2. Define the main function `count_up_to` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of all prime numbers less than `n`. This function will iterate from 2 to `n`, check if each number is prime using the helper function, and add it to the result list if it is.
3. Return the result list.

Now I'll write the code for this.
```python
def count_up_to(n):
    def is_prime(num):
        if num < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    primes = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(i):
            primes.append(i)
    return primes
```
