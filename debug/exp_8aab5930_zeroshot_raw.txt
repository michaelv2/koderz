Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Generate the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer n
2. Extract all the odd numbers from that sequence
3. Return them in a sorted list

Let me trace through the example:
- For n = 5, the Collatz sequence is: 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
- Odd numbers in this sequence: 5, 1
- Sorted: [1, 5]

Here's my approach:
1. Start with the given number n
2. Generate the Collatz sequence by following the rules:
   - If current number is even: divide by 2
   - If current number is odd: multiply by 3 and add 1
3. Keep track of all odd numbers encountered
4. Return the sorted list of odd numbers

```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    odd_numbers = set()
    current = n
    
    while current != 1:
        if current % 2 == 1:  # if current number is odd
            odd_numbers.add(current)
        
        if current % 2 == 0:  # if current number is even
            current = current // 2
        else:  # if current number is odd
            current = 3 * current + 1
    
    # Add 1 to the set since the sequence always ends at 1
    odd_numbers.add(1)
    
    # Return sorted list
    return sorted(list(odd_numbers))
```
