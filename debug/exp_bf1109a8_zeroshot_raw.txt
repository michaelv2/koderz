Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Count vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' in the string (case-insensitive based on the example with "ACEDY")
2. Also count 'y' but only if it's at the end of the word

Let me trace through the examples:
- "abcde": 'a' and 'e' are vowels = 2 ✓
- "ACEDY": 'A', 'E' are vowels, and 'Y' is at the end so it counts = 3 ✓

```python
def vowels_count(s):
    """Write a function vowels_count which takes a string representing
    a word as input and returns the number of vowels in the string.
    Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Here, 'y' is also a
    vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.

    Example:
    >>> vowels_count("abcde")
    2
    >>> vowels_count("ACEDY")
    3
    """
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    count = 0
    
    # Count regular vowels
    for char in s:
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1
    
    # Check if the last character is 'y' or 'Y'
    if s and s[-1] in "yY":
        count += 1
    
    return count
```
