 The problem is asking to find the n-th number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number. To solve this, we can create two helper functions: one to check if a number is prime and another to generate Fibonacci numbers. Then, we iterate through the Fibonacci sequence until we find the n-th prime Fibonacci number.

Here's the Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def prime_fib(n: int) -> int:
    def is_prime(num: int) -> bool:
        if num < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    def fibonacci():
        a, b = 0, 1
        while True:
            yield a
            a, b = b, a + b

    count = 0
    for num in fibonacci():
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
```
