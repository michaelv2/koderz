To solve the problem of counting the number of "boredoms" in a given string, we need to follow these steps:

1. Split the input string into sentences based on punctuation marks ('.', '?', '!').
2. Iterate through each sentence and check if it starts with the word "I".
3. Count the number of sentences that meet the criteria.

Here's the implementation of the function `is_bored`:

```python
def is_bored(S):
    import re
    
    # Split the string into sentences using regex to match '.', '?', or '!'
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)
    
    # Count the number of sentences that start with "I"
    boredom_count = sum(sentence.startswith("I") for sentence in sentences if sentence)
    
    return boredom_count
```

### Explanation:
1. **Splitting the String**: We use `re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)` to split the input string `S` into a list of sentences. The regex pattern `[.?!]\s*` matches any of the punctuation marks ('.', '?', '!') followed by zero or more whitespace characters.
2. **Counting Boredoms**: We use a generator expression inside the `sum` function to count how many sentences start with "I". The condition `sentence.startswith("I")` checks if each sentence starts with the word "I", and `if sentence` ensures that we only consider non-empty sentences.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify and count the number of sentences that are considered "boredoms" based on the given criteria.
