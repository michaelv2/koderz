Problem analysis
- Core challenge: produce a new sequence where each element is the maximum value seen in the input up to the current position (inclusive).
- Constraints:
  - Input is a list of integers (may contain negative values).
  - Output length must match input length.
  - If the input is empty, the output should be an empty list.
  - The function must be a pure transformer (no side effects on inputs).

Implementation specification
- Function signature: rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]
- Behavior:
  - For each index i, output[i] equals the maximum of numbers[0], numbers[1], ..., numbers[i].
  - If numbers is empty, return [].
- Return value: a list of integers of the same length as the input.
- Efficiency considerations: compute in a single pass, constructing the result incrementally.
- Edge cases to be satisfied: all equal values, strictly increasing sequences, strictly decreasing sequences with negative values, large inputs.
