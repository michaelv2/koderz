To solve the problem of finding the two closest elements in a list of numbers, we can follow these steps:

1. Sort the list of numbers.
2. Iterate through the sorted list and compute the differences between consecutive elements.
3. Track the minimum difference and the corresponding pair of elements.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """ From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
    (2.0, 2.2)
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
    (2.0, 2.0)
    """
    # Sort the list of numbers
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    
    # Initialize variables to track the minimum difference and the corresponding pair
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (None, None)
    
    # Iterate through the sorted list and find the closest pair
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        diff = sorted_numbers[i + 1] - sorted_numbers[i]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[i], sorted_numbers[i + 1])
    
    return closest_pair
```
