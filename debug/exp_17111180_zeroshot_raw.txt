To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the range from `x` to `y` inclusive and find the largest even number. If `x` is greater than `y`, we should immediately return `-1` since the range would be invalid. We can start from `y` and move downwards to efficiently find the largest even number.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    if x > y:
        return -1
    for num in range(y, x - 1, -1):
        if num % 2 == 0:
            return num
    return -1
```
