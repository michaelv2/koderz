Looking at this problem, I need to implement a function that checks if a string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

Let me think through the approach:
1. I need to compare the string with its reverse
2. Handle edge cases like empty strings (which should return True)
3. The function should be case-sensitive based on the examples

Here's my implementation:

```python
def is_palindrome(text: str):
    """
    Checks if given string is a palindrome
    >>> is_palindrome('')
    True
    >>> is_palindrome('aba')
    True
    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')
    True
    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')
    False
    """
    return text == text[::-1]
```

The solution is straightforward - I compare the original string with its reverse (using slicing `[::-1]`). This will return True if the string is the same forwards and backwards (i.e., it's a palindrome), and False otherwise.
