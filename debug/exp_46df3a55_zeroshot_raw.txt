To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that is the result of concatenating all the strings in the list. 

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. We will define a function named `concatenate` that accepts one parameter, `strings`, which is a list of strings.
2. We can use Python's built-in `str.join()` method to concatenate the list of strings efficiently. The `join()` method is called on an empty string (`''`) because we want to concatenate the strings without any separator between them.
3. If the input list is empty, `join()` will return an empty string, which matches the expected behavior for the edge case.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string """
    return ''.join(strings)
```
