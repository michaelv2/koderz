Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Split the string into words (separated by spaces)
2. For each word, sort its characters in ascending ASCII order
3. Keep the original spacing and word order
4. Reconstruct the string with sorted words

Let me trace through the examples:
- 'Hi' → 'Hi' (single word, characters H=72, i=105, sorted is Hi)
- 'hello' → 'ehllo' (characters e=101, h=104, l=108, l=108, o=111, sorted is ehllo)
- 'Hello World!!!' → 'Hello !!!Wdlor' (Hello sorted to Hello, World!!! sorted to !!!Wdlor)

```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    words = s.split(' ')
    sorted_words = []
    
    for word in words:
        # Sort characters in the word by ASCII value
        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))
        sorted_words.append(sorted_word)
    
    # Join the sorted words back with spaces
    return ' '.join(sorted_words)
```
