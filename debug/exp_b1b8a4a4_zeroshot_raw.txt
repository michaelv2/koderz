To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each digit of the given positive integer `n`, check if it is odd, and if so, multiply it to an accumulating product. If all digits are even, we should return 0.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize a variable `product` to 1 (since multiplying by 1 has no effect).
2. Convert the integer `n` to a string to easily iterate through each digit.
3. Iterate through each character in the string representation of `n`.
4. Convert each character back to an integer and check if it is odd.
5. If the digit is odd, multiply it with the `product`.
6. After iterating through all digits, check if `product` is still 1 (which means no odd digits were found). If so, return 0; otherwise, return the `product`.

```python
def digits(n):
    product = 1
    has_odd = False
    
    for char in str(n):
        digit = int(char)
        if digit % 2 != 0:
            product *= digit
            has_odd = True
    
    return product if has_odd else 0
```
