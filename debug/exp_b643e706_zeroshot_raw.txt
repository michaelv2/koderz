To solve the problem of calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers, we can break down the task into a few clear steps:

1. **Calculate the mean** of the input list.
2. **Compute the absolute deviations** of each element from the mean.
3. **Calculate the average** of these absolute deviations to get the MAD.

Here's how we can implement this in Python:

- First, we calculate the mean of the numbers using the `sum()` function and dividing by the length of the list.
- Then, we use a generator expression inside the `sum()` function to compute the sum of the absolute differences between each number and the mean.
- Finally, we divide this sum by the number of elements to get the mean absolute deviation.

Let's implement this in code:

```python
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    """
    if not numbers:
        return 0.0  # Return 0 for an empty list to avoid division by zero

    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    mad = sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
    return mad
```

This function handles the calculation as described and includes a check for an empty list to avoid division by zero, returning 0.0 in that case.
