To solve this problem, we need to determine if the given number `n` is a prime number. If it is, we return `x`; otherwise, we return `y`. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Check if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it's not a prime number.
2. Check for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it's not a prime number.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, `n` is a prime number.

Now, let's implement this logic in the function:

```python
def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    if n <= 1:
        return y
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return y
    return x
```
