I need to implement a function that converts a decimal number to a different base and returns its string representation.

Let me think through the approach:
1. I need to repeatedly divide the number by the base
2. The remainder at each step becomes a digit in the new base
3. I continue until the number becomes 0
4. The digits are generated in reverse order (least significant first), so I need to reverse them

Let me trace through the examples:
- `change_base(8, 3)`: 8÷3=2 remainder 2, 2÷3=0 remainder 2 → "22"
- `change_base(8, 2)`: 8÷2=4 remainder 0, 4÷2=2 remainder 0, 2÷2=1 remainder 0, 1÷2=0 remainder 1 → "1000"
- `change_base(7, 2)`: 7÷2=3 remainder 1, 3÷2=1 remainder 1, 1÷2=0 remainder 1 → "111"

```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int):
    """Change numerical base of input number x to base.
    return string representation after the conversion.
    base numbers are less than 10.
    >>> change_base(8, 3)
    '22'
    >>> change_base(8, 2)
    '1000'
    >>> change_base(7, 2)
    '111'
    """
    if x == 0:
        return '0'
    
    result = ''
    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % base
        result = str(remainder) + result
        x = x // base
    
    return result
```
