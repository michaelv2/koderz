To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the list and check each element that is in an even index (0, 2, 4, ...). If the element at that index is odd, we add it to a running sum. Finally, we return the sum.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def solution(lst):
    total = 0
    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):  # Iterate over even indices
        if lst[i] % 2 != 0:  # Check if the element is odd
            total += lst[i]
    return total
```
