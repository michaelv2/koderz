To solve the problem of finding the derivative of a polynomial represented by its coefficients, we need to follow these steps:

1. Iterate through the list of coefficients.
2. For each coefficient at index `i`, multiply it by `i` to get the coefficient of the derivative term at position `i-1`.
3. Skip the first coefficient since its derivative is zero and does not appear in the result.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def derivative(xs: list):
    """ xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
     Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
    >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
    [1, 4, 12, 20]
    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 6]
    """
    return [i * coeff for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)][1:]
```
