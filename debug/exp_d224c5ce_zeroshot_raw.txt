Looking at this problem, I need to understand what `encode_cyclic` does and then implement `decode_cyclic` to reverse it.

Let me trace through `encode_cyclic`:
1. It splits the string into groups of 3 characters
2. For each group that has exactly 3 characters, it cycles them (moves first character to the end)
3. Groups with fewer than 3 characters remain unchanged
4. It joins all groups back together

For example: "abcdefg" → ["abc", "def", "g"] → ["bca", "efd", "g"] → "bcaefdg"

To decode, I need to reverse this process:
1. Split the encoded string into groups of 3 characters
2. For each group that has exactly 3 characters, reverse the cycle (move last character to the front)
3. Groups with fewer than 3 characters remain unchanged
4. Join all groups back together

```python
def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # reverse cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)
```
