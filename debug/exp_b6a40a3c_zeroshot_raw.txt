Looking at this problem, I need to check if brackets are properly matched. The key insight is to count the balance of brackets:
- Each "<" increases the balance by 1
- Each ">" decreases the balance by 1
- At any point, the balance should never go negative (can't have more closing than opening brackets)
- At the end, the balance should be exactly 0 (all brackets matched)

Let me trace through the examples:
- "<" → balance goes from 0 to 1, then ends at 1 → False (unmatched)
- "<>" → balance: 0→1→0 → True (matched)
- "<<><>>" → balance: 0→1→2→1→2→1→0 → True (matched)
- "><<>" → balance: 0→-1 → False (negative balance)

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    balance = 0
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "<":
            balance += 1
        elif bracket == ">":
            balance -= 1
        # If balance goes negative, we have unmatched closing brackets
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    # All brackets matched if balance is exactly 0
    return balance == 0
```
