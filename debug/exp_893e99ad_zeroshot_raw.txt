Let me reason through this problem:

1. I need to create an ordered list of planets from closest to farthest from the Sun
2. Find the positions of both planet1 and planet2 in this list
3. Return all planets between them (in order by proximity to Sun)
4. Handle invalid planet names by returning an empty tuple
5. The order should be consistent regardless of which planet is closer to the Sun

Here's my approach:
- Define the planets in order from Mercury to Neptune
- Check if both planets are valid (in the list)
- Find their indices
- Get the planets between them (using min and max indices to handle both orderings)
- Return as a tuple

```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune")
    
    # Check if both planets are valid
    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:
        return ()
    
    # Get indices of both planets
    index1 = planets.index(planet1)
    index2 = planets.index(planet2)
    
    # Get the range between them (handle both orderings)
    start = min(index1, index2)
    end = max(index1, index2)
    
    # Return planets between them (excluding the two input planets)
    return planets[start + 1:end]
```
