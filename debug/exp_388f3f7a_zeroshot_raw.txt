To calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the mean of the input numbers.
2. Compute the absolute difference between each number and the mean.
3. Calculate the average of these absolute differences.

Here's the Python function implementing this logic:

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """ For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """
    if not numbers:
        return 0.0
    
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    absolute_deviations = [abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]
    mad = sum(absolute_deviations) / len(absolute_deviations)
    
    return mad
```
