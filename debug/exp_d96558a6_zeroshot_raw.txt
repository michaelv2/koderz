To determine if a number \( n \) is prime, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and the number itself.

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement the `is_prime` function:

1. **Handle edge cases**: Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.
2. **Check divisibility**: For numbers greater than 1, check if they are divisible by any number from 2 up to the square root of \( n \). If \( n \) is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.

The reason for checking up to the square root of \( n \) is that a larger factor of \( n \) must be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked.

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
