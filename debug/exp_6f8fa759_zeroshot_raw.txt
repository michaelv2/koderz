Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Take a list of numbers and a delimiter
2. Insert the delimiter between every two consecutive elements
3. Return the modified list

For example, `[1, 2, 3]` with delimiter `4` becomes `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]`

The approach:
- If the list is empty, return empty list
- For each element except the last, add the element followed by the delimiter
- Add the last element without a delimiter after it

```python
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    if not numbers:
        return []
    
    result = []
    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        result.append(num)
        if i < len(numbers) - 1:
            result.append(delimeter)
    
    return result
```
