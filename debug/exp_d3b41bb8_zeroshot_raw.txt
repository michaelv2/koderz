To solve this problem, we need to iterate over the list of strings and check if each string starts with the given prefix. If it does, we include it in the result list. We can use Python's built-in `str.startswith()` method for this purpose.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```
