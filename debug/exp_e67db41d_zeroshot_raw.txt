I will sum the list and multiply elements iteratively, handling the empty list by initializing sum to 0 and product to 1.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    s = 0
    p = 1
    for n in numbers:
        s += n
        p *= n
    return s, p
```
