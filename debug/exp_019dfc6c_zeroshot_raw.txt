To solve this problem, we need to create a function that takes a list as input and returns a new list containing the unique elements from the original list, sorted in ascending order. Here's how I plan to achieve this:

1. Convert the list to a set to remove duplicate elements.
2. Convert the set back to a list.
3. Sort the list.
4. Return the sorted list.

This approach ensures that we get only unique elements and that they are sorted, as required by the problem statement.

```python
def unique(l: list):
    return sorted(set(l))
```
