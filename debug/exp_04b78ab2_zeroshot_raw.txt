Let me reason through this problem:

1. We have n cars driving left to right (→)
2. We have n cars driving right to left (←)
3. All cars move at the same speed
4. Cars pass through each other when they collide
5. We need to count total collisions

Key insight: 
- Each car going left to right (→) will eventually meet each car going right to left (←)
- Since they're moving at the same speed and start far apart, every → car will collide with every ← car exactly once
- With n cars in each direction, the total number of collisions is n × n = n²

This is because:
- The first left-to-right car will collide with all n right-to-left cars
- The second left-to-right car will collide with all n right-to-left cars
- And so on for all n left-to-right cars
- Total: n × n = n²

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * n
```
