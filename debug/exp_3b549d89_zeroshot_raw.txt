 The problem is about checking if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. To solve this, we can generate all possible rotations of the second word and check if any of them are present as a substring in the first word.

Here's how I plan to implement the function:
1. Define a helper function `rotate` that takes a string and an index as input and returns the rotated string.
2. In the main function, generate all possible rotations of the second word using the `rotate` function.
3. Check if any of these rotations are present as a substring in the first word using the `in` operator. If yes, return True; otherwise, return False.

Now, let's write the code:

```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    def rotate(s, i):
        return s[i:] + s[:i]

    for i in range(len(b)):
        if rotate(b, i) in a:
            return True
    return False
```
