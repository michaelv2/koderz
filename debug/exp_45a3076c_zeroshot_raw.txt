I will check each word's length and test whether that length is a prime number (>=2). Words with prime lengths are collected in order and joined with a single space; if none match, an empty string is returned.

```python
def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers,
    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.
    """
    def is_prime(n):
        if n < 2:
            return False
        if n in (2, 3):
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return False
        i = 3
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
            i += 2
        return True

    words = sentence.split()
    result = [w for w in words if is_prime(len(w))]
    return " ".join(result)
