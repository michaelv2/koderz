Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Take two binary strings as input
2. Perform XOR operation on each corresponding bit
3. Return the result as a string

XOR logic: 0^0=0, 0^1=1, 1^0=1, 1^1=0

I'll iterate through both strings character by character, apply XOR to each bit pair, and concatenate the results.

```python
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(str(int(x) ^ int(y)) for x, y in zip(a, b))
```
