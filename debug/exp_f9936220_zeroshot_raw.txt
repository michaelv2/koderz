Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Calculate the factorial of each number from n down to 1
2. Multiply all these factorials together

For example, with n=4:
- 4! = 24
- 3! = 6
- 2! = 2
- 1! = 1
- Result = 24 × 6 × 2 × 1 = 288

Let me trace through the logic:
- I need a helper function to calculate factorial, or use math.factorial
- For each number i from n down to 1, calculate i! and multiply them all together

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    def factorial(x):
        if x <= 1:
            return 1
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, x + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
    
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= factorial(i)
    
    return result
```
