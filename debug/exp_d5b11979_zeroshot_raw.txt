 The problem is about writing a Python function that takes a list as input and returns a new list containing the unique elements of the input list, sorted in ascending order. To solve this problem, we can use the built-in `set` data structure to remove duplicates from the list, then convert the set back to a list and sort it using the `sorted()` function.

Here's the complete function implementation:

```python
def unique(l: list):
    return sorted(list(set(l)))
```
