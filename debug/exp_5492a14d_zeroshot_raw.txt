Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Iterate through the list of numbers
2. Filter for numbers that are:
   - Odd (not divisible by 2)
   - Non-negative (≥ 0)
   - Integers (no decimal part)
3. Square each qualifying number
4. Sum all the squares
5. Return 0 for empty lists

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[1, 3, 2, 0]`: 1 is odd and positive, 3 is odd and positive, 2 is even, 0 is even. So 1² + 3² = 1 + 9 = 10
- `[-1, -2, 0]`: -1 is odd but negative, -2 is even and negative, 0 is even and non-negative. So 0
- `[9, -2]`: 9 is odd and positive, -2 is even and negative. So 9² = 81
- `[0]`: 0 is even and non-negative. So 0

```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    total = 0
    for num in lst:
        # Check if the number is an integer and non-negative
        if isinstance(num, int) and num >= 0:
            # Check if the number is odd
            if num % 2 == 1:
                total += num ** 2
    return total
```
