To solve the problem of factorizing an integer into its prime factors, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the smallest prime number (2) and check if it divides the given number.
2. If it does, add 2 to the list of factors and divide the number by 2.
3. Repeat step 2 until 2 no longer divides the number.
4. Move to the next potential factor (3) and repeat the process.
5. Continue this process with increasing odd numbers until the number is reduced to 1.

Here's the complete function implementation:

```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]
    """
    factors = []
    # Start with the smallest prime number
    divisor = 2
    while n >= divisor:
        if n % divisor == 0:
            factors.append(divisor)
            n //= divisor
        else:
            divisor += 1
    return factors
```
