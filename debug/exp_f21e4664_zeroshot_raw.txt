To solve this problem, we need to create a function `incr_list` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1. We can achieve this using a list comprehension, which provides a concise way to apply an operation to each element in the list.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    return [x + 1 for x in l]
```
