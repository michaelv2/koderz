To solve the problem of removing vowels from a given string, we can follow these steps:

1. Define what constitutes a vowel. In this case, we'll consider both uppercase and lowercase vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').
2. Iterate through each character in the input string.
3. Check if the character is a vowel.
4. If it's not a vowel, add it to the result string.
5. Return the result string after processing all characters.

This approach ensures that we efficiently filter out vowels while preserving the order and case of other characters in the string.

```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return ''.join(char for char in text if char not in vowels)
```

This implementation uses a generator expression within the `join` method to construct the resulting string by including only those characters that are not vowels.
