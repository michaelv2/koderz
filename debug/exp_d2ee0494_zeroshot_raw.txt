Let me reason through this problem:

1. I need to identify indices that are divisible by 3 (0, 3, 6, 9, ...)
2. Extract the values at those indices
3. Sort those values
4. Place the sorted values back at the indices divisible by 3
5. Keep all other values in their original positions

Let me trace through the second example:
- Input: [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
- Indices divisible by 3: 0, 3, 6
- Values at those indices: 5, 4, 2
- Sorted: 2, 4, 5
- Place back: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
- Non-divisible by 3 indices (1, 2, 4, 5) keep original values: 6, 3, 8, 9 ✓

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """
    # Extract values at indices divisible by 3
    third_values = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0]
    
    # Sort those values
    third_values.sort()
    
    # Create result list
    result = l.copy()
    
    # Place sorted values back at indices divisible by 3
    third_index = 0
    for i in range(len(result)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result[i] = third_values[third_index]
            third_index += 1
    
    return result
