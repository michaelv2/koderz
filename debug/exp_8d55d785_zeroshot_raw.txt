To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the list of numbers and check each number for two conditions:
1. The number should be greater than 10.
2. Both the first and last digits of the number should be odd.

We can convert the number to a string to easily access the first and last digits. We also need to handle negative numbers by considering only their absolute values when checking the digits.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    def is_odd_digit(digit):
        return digit in {'1', '3', '5', '7', '9'}
    
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            str_num = str(abs(num))
            if is_odd_digit(str_num[0]) and is_odd_digit(str_num[-1]):
                count += 1
    return count
```
