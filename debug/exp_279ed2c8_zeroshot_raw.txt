 The problem is about finding the largest prime factor of a given number `n`. To solve this, we can start by dividing `n` by 2 until it's no longer divisible by 2. Then, we iterate through odd numbers starting from 3 and divide `n` by each number until it's no longer divisible. The last divisor will be the largest prime factor of `n`.

Here is the Python function that implements this solution:

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:
    # Divide n by 2 until it's no longer divisible by 2
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n = n // 2

    # n must be odd at this point, so a skip of 2 can be used
    i = 3
    while i * i <= n:
        # While i divides n, divide n by i and update the largest prime factor
        while n % i == 0:
            n = n // i
            largest_prime = i
        i += 2

    # This condition is to handle the case when n is a prime number greater than 2
    if n > 2:
        largest_prime = n

    return largest_prime
```
