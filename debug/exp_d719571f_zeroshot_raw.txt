To solve this problem, we need to generate the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer `n` and extract all the odd numbers from this sequence. After collecting these odd numbers, we will sort them in increasing order before returning.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the odd numbers.
2. Use a loop to generate the Collatz sequence starting from `n`.
3. In each iteration of the loop, check if the current number is odd. If it is, add it to the list of odd numbers.
4. Update the current number according to the rules of the Collatz sequence:
   - If the number is even, divide it by 2.
   - If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
5. Continue this process until the number becomes 1.
6. Once the loop ends, sort the list of odd numbers in increasing order.
7. Return the sorted list.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    odd_numbers = []
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 != 0:
            odd_numbers.append(n)
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n //= 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
    odd_numbers.append(1)  # Add the final number 1 to the list
    return sorted(odd_numbers)
```
