```python
def encrypt(s):
    encrypted_text = ""
    for char in s:
        # Get the ASCII value of the character and add 2*2 to it
        new_char_code = ord(char) + 4
        # If the new character code is greater than 'z', subtract 26 to wrap around to the start of the alphabet
        if new_char_code > ord('z'):
            new_char_code -= 26
        # Convert the ASCII value back to a character and add it to the encrypted text
        encrypted_text += chr(new_char_code)
    return encrypted_text
