Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Find the largest negative integer in the list
2. Find the smallest positive integer in the list
3. Return them as a tuple (largest_negative, smallest_positive)
4. If no negative or positive integers exist, return None for that position

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]`: No negative numbers, smallest positive is 1 → (None, 1)
- `[]`: Empty list → (None, None)  
- `[0]`: Zero is neither positive nor negative → (None, None)

```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    largest_negative = None
    smallest_positive = None
    
    for num in lst:
        if num < 0:
            if largest_negative is None or num > largest_negative:
                largest_negative = num
        elif num > 0:
            if smallest_positive is None or num < smallest_positive:
                smallest_positive = num
        # Skip zero (num == 0) as it's neither positive nor negative
    
    return (largest_negative, smallest_positive)
```
