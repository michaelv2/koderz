To solve this problem, we need to identify the elements at indices divisible by three, sort those elements, and then place them back into their original positions in the list. Here's how I plan to implement this:

1. Iterate through the list and collect elements at indices that are divisible by three.
2. Sort the collected elements.
3. Create a new list where we replace the elements at indices divisible by three with the sorted elements, while keeping other elements unchanged.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    # Collect elements at indices divisible by 3
    divisible_by_three = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0]
    
    # Sort the collected elements
    sorted_divisible_by_three = sorted(divisible_by_three)
    
    # Create a new list with sorted elements at indices divisible by 3
    result = l[:]
    index = 0
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result[i] = sorted_divisible_by_three[index]
            index += 1
    
    return result
```
