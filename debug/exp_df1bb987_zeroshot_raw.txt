Looking at this problem, I need to implement a "strange sort" where:
1. Start with the minimum value
2. Then take the maximum of remaining values
3. Then take the minimum of remaining values
4. Continue alternating until all elements are processed

Let me trace through the first example:
- [1, 2, 3, 4]: min=1, then max of [2,3,4]=4, then min of [2,3]=2, then max of [3]=3
- Result: [1, 4, 2, 3]

My approach:
1. Sort the list first
2. Use two pointers (left and right) to track min and max positions
3. Alternate between picking from left (min) and right (max)
4. Continue until all elements are picked

```python
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    if not lst:
        return []
    
    # Sort the list first
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    result = []
    
    # Use two pointers
    left = 0
    right = len(sorted_lst) - 1
    pick_min = True  # Flag to alternate between min and max
    
    # Continue until all elements are picked
    while left <= right:
        if pick_min:
            result.append(sorted_lst[left])
            left += 1
        else:
            result.append(sorted_lst[right])
            right -= 1
        pick_min = not pick_min  # Alternate for next iteration
    
    return result
```
