To solve the problem of finding the largest prime factor of a given integer `n`, we can use a method that iteratively divides `n` by its smallest factors until we reach the largest prime factor. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.
2. Divide `n` by 2 as long as it is divisible by 2.
3. Move to the next potential factor (which will be an odd number) and repeat the process of dividing `n` until it is no longer divisible by that factor.
4. Continue this process, incrementing the factor by 2 each time (to check only odd numbers), until the square of the factor exceeds `n`.
5. If after all these divisions `n` is still greater than 1, then `n` itself is a prime number and is the largest prime factor.
6. Otherwise, the last factor used in the division process is the largest prime factor.

Here's the implementation of this approach:

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n: int):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    # Start with the smallest prime number
    factor = 2
    
    # Divide n by 2 until it is no longer divisible by 2
    while n % factor == 0:
        n //= factor
    
    # Check for odd factors from 3 onwards
    factor = 3
    while factor * factor <= n:
        while n % factor == 0:
            n //= factor
        factor += 2
    
    # If n is still greater than 1, then it is the largest prime factor
    return n if n > 1 else factor - 2
```

This function efficiently finds the largest prime factor by reducing the problem size at each step and only checking necessary factors.
