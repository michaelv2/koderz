To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the array and find the largest index where an element is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, we return -1.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize a variable `max_index` to -1. This will store the largest index found that meets the condition.
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element (index 1).
3. For each element, compare it with the previous element.
4. If the current element is less than the previous element, update `max_index` with the current index.
5. After the loop, return `max_index`.

Let's implement this logic in the function:

```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    max_index = -1
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index
```
