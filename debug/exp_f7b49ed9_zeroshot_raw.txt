To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the array and find the largest index where the current element is not greater than or equal to the previous element. If no such element exists, we return -1.

Here's a step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize a variable `max_index` to -1.
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element (index 1).
3. For each element, check if it is less than the element immediately preceding it.
4. If it is, update `max_index` with the current index.
5. Continue until the end of the array.
6. Return `max_index`.

```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    max_index = -1
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index
```
