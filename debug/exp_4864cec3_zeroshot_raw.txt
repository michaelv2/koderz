To solve this problem, we need to count the number of prime digits in a given hexadecimal string. The prime digits in the context of hexadecimal numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, B (11 in decimal), and D (13 in decimal). We can achieve this by iterating through each character in the string, checking if it is one of these prime digits, and maintaining a count.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def hex_key(num):
    # Define the set of prime hexadecimal digits
    prime_hex_digits = {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}
    
    # Initialize a counter for prime digits
    prime_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in num:
        # Check if the character is a prime digit
        if char in prime_hex_digits:
            # Increment the counter if it is a prime digit
            prime_count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of prime digits
    return prime_count
```
