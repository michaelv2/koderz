 The problem requires us to iterate over each element of the list and apply certain transformations based on the index of the element. If the index is a multiple of 3, we square the number; if it's a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3 (to avoid double-counting), we cube the number. We then sum up all these transformed numbers and return the result.

Here's how I plan to solve this:
1. Initialize a variable `total` to store the sum of the transformed numbers.
2. Iterate over each element in the list with its index.
3. Check if the index is a multiple of 3, and if so, square the number and add it to `total`.
4. Check if the index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3, and if so, cube the number and add it to `total`.
5. Return the final value of `total`.

Now I'll write this solution in Python code:

```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    total = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            total += num ** 2
        elif i % 4 == 0:
            total += num ** 3
    return total
```
