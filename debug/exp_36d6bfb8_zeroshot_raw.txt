 The problem is about finding the number of times a given substring can be found in an original string, including overlapping cases. To solve this, we can use a loop to iterate through the original string and check for the presence of the substring at each position. If the substring is found, we increment a counter and continue searching from the next position after the end of the last found substring.

Here's the Python function that implements this solution:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    count = 0
    start = 0
    while start < len(string):
        pos = string.find(substring, start)
        if pos != -1:
            count += 1
            start = pos + 1
        else:
            break
    return count
```
