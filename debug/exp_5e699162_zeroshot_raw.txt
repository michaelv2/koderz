```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    """Your task is to write a function that returns true if a number x is a simple
    power of n and false in other cases.
    x is a simple power of n if n**int=x
    For example:
    is_simple_power(1, 4) => true
    is_simple_power(2, 2) => true
    is_simple_power(8, 2) => true
    is_simple_power(3, 2) => false
    is_simple_power(3, 1) => false
    is_simple_power(5, 3) => false
    """
    if x < 1 or n < 1:
        return False
    while x % n == 0:
        x /= n
    return x == 1.0
```
This function works by continuously dividing the input number `x` by `n` until it is not divisible anymore. If at any point, `x` becomes 1, then `x` is a simple power of `n`. Otherwise, `x` is not a simple power of `n`.

The function also returns False if either `x` or `n` are less than 1 because the problem statement specifies that both inputs should be positive integers.
