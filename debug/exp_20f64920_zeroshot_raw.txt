 The problem is asking to find the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by either 11 or 13. To solve this, we can iterate through all numbers from 0 to n-1 and check if each number is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, then we count the number of times the digit 7 appears in that number.

Here's my plan:
1. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of times the digit 7 appears.
2. Iterate through all numbers from 0 to n-1.
3. For each number, check if it is divisible by either 11 or 13 using the modulo operator (%).
4. If the number is divisible, convert it to a string and count the number of times the digit '7' appears in that string. Add this count to our counter variable.
5. After iterating through all numbers, return the value of the counter variable.

Now I will write the Python function to solve this problem.
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            count += str(i).count('7')
    return count
```
