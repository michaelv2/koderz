Problem analysis:
- Core challenge: Given a list of at least two numbers, identify two elements with the smallest absolute difference and return them in increasing order.
- Constraints: Input length >= 2; numbers are real values (floats). If duplicates exist, the pair with equal values yields a zero difference.

Implementation specification:
- Input: A list of floats.
- Output: A tuple of two floats (a, b) where a <= b and b - a is the minimal possible difference among all pairs.
- Behavior details:
  - If the input length is less than 2, raise an error.
  - Sort the numbers and find the minimal difference between adjacent elements.
  - Return the corresponding pair (the smaller, then the larger value).

```python
def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """ From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
    (2.0, 2.2)
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
    (2.0, 2.0)
    """

    best_diff = best_b - best_a

    for i in range(1, len(nums) - 1):
        a, b = nums[i], nums[i + 1]
