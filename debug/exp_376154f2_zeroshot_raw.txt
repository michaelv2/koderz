Looking at this problem, I need to determine if concatenating two strings of parentheses in either order can create a balanced string.

Let me think through the approach:
1. For each string, I need to calculate how many unmatched opening parentheses and closing parentheses there are
2. When concatenating strings, the order matters - I need to check both possible orders
3. A string is balanced if:
   - Total opening and closing parentheses are equal
   - At no point while reading left to right do closing parentheses exceed opening ones

Let me trace through the examples:
- `['()(', ')']`: 
  - Order 1: `()()` - balanced ✓
  - Order 2: `)(()` - not balanced (starts with ')')
- `[')', ')']`:
  - Order 1: `))` - not balanced
  - Order 2: `))` - not balanced

I'll create a helper function to check if a string is balanced, then try both concatenation orders.

```python
def match_parens(lst):
    def is_balanced(s):
        balance = 0
        for char in s:
            if char == '(':
                balance += 1
            elif char == ')':
                balance -= 1
            if balance < 0:
                return False
        return balance == 0
    
    # Try both possible concatenations
    order1 = lst[0] + lst[1]
    order2 = lst[1] + lst[0]
    
    if is_balanced(order1) or is_balanced(order2):
        return 'Yes'
    else:
        return 'No'
```
