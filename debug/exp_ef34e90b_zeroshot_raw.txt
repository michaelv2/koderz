Problem analysis:
- Count how many times the digit '7' appears in the decimal representations of integers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13. n is an integer (treat n<=0 as yielding zero occurrences).

Implementation specification:
- Function fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int
- Iterate over integers k with 0 <= k < n, select those where k % 11 == 0 or k % 13 == 0.
- Sum the occurrences of the character '7' in the decimal string of each selected k.
- Return the total count as an integer.

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."""
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    total = 0
    for k in range(n):
        if k % 11 == 0 or k % 13 == 0:
            total += str(k).count('7')
    return total
```
