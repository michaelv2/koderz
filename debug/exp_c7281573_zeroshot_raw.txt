 The problem requires us to reverse the case of letters in a string and keep non-letters as they are. If there are no letters in the string, we should reverse it. To solve this, I will iterate through each character in the string. If the character is a letter, I'll check if it's lowercase or uppercase and convert it to the opposite case. If it's not a letter, I'll keep it as it is. After going through all characters, if there were no letters in the string, I'll reverse the entire string.

Here's my solution:

```python
def solve(s):
    result = []
    has_letter = False
    for char in s:
        if char.isalpha():
            has_letter = True
            if char.islower():
                result.append(char.upper())
            else:
                result.append(char.lower())
        else:
            result.append(char)
    return ''.join(result[::-1]) if not has_letter else ''.join(result)
```
