 The problem is about finding a zero point of a polynomial function given its coefficients. The function `find_zero` takes a list of coefficients as input and returns the value of x such that poly(x) = 0.

The approach to solve this problem is to use the bisection method, which is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous function for which one knows two values with opposite signs. The method works by repeatedly bisecting an interval and then selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign, and therefore must contain a root.

Here's the Python code implementation of the `find_zero` function:

```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    # Initialize the interval [a, b]
    a = 0
    b = 1

    # Set the tolerance and maximum number of iterations
    tol = 1e-6
    max_iter = 1000

    # Check if f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs
    if poly(xs, a) * poly(xs, b) > 0:
        raise ValueError("The interval [a, b] does not contain a root.")

    # Perform the bisection method
    for _ in range(max_iter):
        c = (a + b) / 2
        if poly(xs, c) == 0 or abs(b - a) < tol:
            return c
        elif poly(xs, a) * poly(xs, c) < 0:
            b = c
        else:
            a = c

    raise ValueError("The method did not converge.")
