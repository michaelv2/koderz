To solve this problem, we need to iterate through all integers less than `n` and check two conditions for each integer:
1. The integer must be divisible by either 11 or 13.
2. We need to count how many times the digit '7' appears in those integers.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:
- Loop through all numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each number, check if it is divisible by 11 or 13.
- If it is, convert the number to a string and count the occurrences of the digit '7'.
- Keep a running total of these counts.
- Return the total count after checking all numbers.

Let's implement this logic in the `fizz_buzz` function:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            count += str(i).count('7')
    return count
```

This function will correctly compute the number of times the digit '7' appears in integers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13.
