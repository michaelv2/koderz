To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the given list and filter out only the positive numbers. A number is considered positive if it is greater than zero. We can achieve this using a list comprehension, which provides a concise way to create lists based on existing lists.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Iterate over each element in the input list `l`.
2. Check if the element is greater than zero.
3. If the condition is true, include the element in the resulting list.
4. Return the resulting list containing only positive numbers.

Using a list comprehension makes this process both efficient and easy to read.

```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    """Return only positive numbers in the list."""
    return [num for num in l if num > 0]
```
