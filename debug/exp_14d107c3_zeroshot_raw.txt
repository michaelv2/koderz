To solve the problem of factorizing an integer into its prime factors, we can use a straightforward approach:

1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.
2. Divide the given number `n` by this prime number as long as it is divisible.
3. Record each division in the result list.
4. Move to the next potential factor and repeat the process until `n` becomes 1.
5. The factors should be collected in ascending order, which is naturally achieved by starting from the smallest prime and moving upwards.

This approach ensures that we capture all prime factors of the number, including their multiplicities.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
    """
    factors = []
    divisor = 2
    while n > 1:
        while n % divisor == 0:
            factors.append(divisor)
            n //= divisor
        divisor += 1
    return factors
```

This function will correctly factorize any positive integer into its prime components, listing each prime factor the number of times it divides the original number.
