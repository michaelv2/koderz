Let me reason through this problem:

1. I need to find the biggest even integer in the range [x, y] inclusive
2. If no even integer exists in that range, return -1
3. Edge cases:
   - If x > y, return -1 (invalid range)
   - If y is even, that's our answer (it's the largest number in range)
   - If y is odd, check y-1 (if it's >= x and even)
   - If the resulting number is < x, return -1

The most efficient approach:
- Start from y and go backwards
- Return the first even number we find that is >= x
- If we don't find any, return -1

```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If 
    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.

    For example:
    choose_num(12, 15) = 14
    choose_num(13, 12) = -1
    """
    if x > y:
        return -1
    
    # Start from y and find the largest even number
    if y % 2 == 0:
        return y
    elif y - 1 >= x:
        return y - 1
    else:
        return -1
```
