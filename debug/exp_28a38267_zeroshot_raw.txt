To solve this problem, we need to implement a function `count_up_to(n)` that returns an array of the first `n` prime numbers and less than `n`. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Prime Number Check**: We need a helper function to check if a number is prime.
2. **Generate Primes**: Iterate through numbers starting from 2 and use the helper function to filter out non-prime numbers.
3. **Limit the Output**: Ensure that we only return the first `n` prime numbers.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_up_to(n):
    """Function that returns the first n prime numbers less than n."""
    primes = []
    num = 2
    while len(primes) < n and num < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            primes.append(num)
        num += 1
    return primes
```

This code defines a helper function `is_prime` to check for prime numbers and the main function `count_up_to` to generate the required list of prime numbers. The loop continues until we have collected `n` prime numbers or we reach the number `n`.
