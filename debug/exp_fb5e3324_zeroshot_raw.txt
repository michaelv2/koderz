To solve this problem, we need to generate the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer `n` and then filter out the odd numbers from that sequence. Finally, we will sort the list of odd numbers before returning it.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Generate the Collatz Sequence**: Start with the given number `n`. For each term in the sequence:
   - If the term is even, divide it by 2.
   - If the term is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
   - Continue this process until the sequence reaches 1.

2. **Filter Odd Numbers**: As we generate the Collatz sequence, collect only the odd numbers.

3. **Sort the List**: Once all odd numbers are collected, sort them in increasing order.

4. **Return the Result**: Return the sorted list of odd numbers.

Here's the complete function implementation:

```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    collatz_sequence = []
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            collatz_sequence.append(n)
            n = 3 * n + 1
    collatz_sequence.append(1)  # Add the final term of the sequence, which is 1
    return sorted(collatz_sequence)
```

This function follows the Collatz conjecture rules to generate the sequence and filters out the odd numbers before sorting them and returning the result.
