Looking at this problem, I need to find if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

The approach:
1. For each element `x` in the list, check if its negative `-x` exists in the list
2. Make sure they are distinct elements (different positions)
3. Return True if such a pair exists, False otherwise

I can use a set for efficient lookup while iterating through the list.

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
    seen = set()
    for num in l:
        if -num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```
