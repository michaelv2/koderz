 The problem requires us to iterate over a given list of numbers and sum up the squares of all odd positive integers. We will ignore negative numbers and non-integers. If the input list is empty, we should return 0.

Here's how I plan to solve this:
1. Initialize a variable `sum` to store the result.
2. Iterate over each number in the given list.
3. Check if the number is an integer and greater than zero. If not, continue to the next iteration.
4. Check if the number is odd by using the modulo operator (%). If it's not odd, continue to the next iteration.
5. Square the number and add it to `sum`.
6. After iterating over all numbers, return `sum`.

Now I will write the Python function for this plan:

```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    sum = 0
    for num in lst:
        if isinstance(num, int) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0:
            sum += num ** 2
    return sum
```
