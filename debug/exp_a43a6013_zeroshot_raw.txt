To solve this problem, we need to generate a list where each element represents the number of stones at that level of the pile. The first level has `n` stones, and each subsequent level's stone count is determined by whether `n` is odd or even.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the number of stones at each level.
2. Start with the given number of stones `n` for the first level.
3. For each subsequent level, determine the next stone count based on whether `n` is odd or even:
   - If `n` is odd, add 2 to get the next odd number.
   - If `n` is even, add 1 to get the next even number.
4. Append the current stone count to the list and continue until all levels are generated.

```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = []
    current_stones = n
    for i in range(n):
        pile.append(current_stones)
        if n % 2 == 0:
            current_stones += 1
        else:
            current_stones += 2
    return pile
```
