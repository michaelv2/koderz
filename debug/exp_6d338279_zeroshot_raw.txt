 The problem is about removing all the duplicate elements from a list of integers while maintaining the order of the remaining elements as they appear in the input list. To solve this, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the count of each number in the list and then filter out the numbers that occur more than once.

Here's the Python function implementation:

```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    num_count = {}
    for num in numbers:
        if num in num_count:
            num_count[num] += 1
        else:
            num_count[num] = 1
    return [num for num in numbers if num_count[num] == 1]
```
