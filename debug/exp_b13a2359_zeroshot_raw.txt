To solve the problem of generating a list of rolling maximum elements from a given list of integers, we can iterate through the list while keeping track of the maximum value encountered so far. For each element in the list, we append the current maximum to the result list.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the rolling maximum values.
2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current maximum value.
3. Iterate through the input list.
4. For each element, update the current maximum if the current element is greater than the current maximum.
5. Append the current maximum to the result list.

```python
from typing import List


def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment in the sequence.
    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
    if not numbers:
        return []
    
    result = []
    current_max = float('-inf')
    
    for number in numbers:
        if number > current_max:
            current_max = number
        result.append(current_max)
    
    return result
```
