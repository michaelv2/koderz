Problem analysis
- Core challenge: Determine how many distinct characters appear in the input string, treating uppercase and lowercase as the same character.
- Constraints: input is a string; all characters (including spaces and punctuation) should be considered as characters; empty input yields 0.

Implementation specification
- The function accepts a single string argument and returns an integer.
- Normalize the string to a single case (lowercase).
- Compute the set of characters from the normalized string.
- Return the size of this set as the count of distinct characters.

```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len(set(string.lower()))
```
