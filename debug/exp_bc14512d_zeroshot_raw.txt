Looking at this problem, I need to find the derivative of a polynomial represented by its coefficients.

Given a polynomial: xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + xs[3] * x^3 + ...
The derivative would be: xs[1] + 2*xs[2] * x + 3*xs[3] * x^2 + ...

So for each term xs[i] * x^i, the derivative is i * xs[i] * x^(i-1).

The key insights:
1. The constant term (xs[0]) disappears in the derivative
2. For term xs[i] * x^i, the derivative is i * xs[i] * x^(i-1)
3. The result should have one fewer term than the input
4. The first term of the derivative is xs[1] (since xs[1] * x becomes xs[1] after differentiation)

Let me trace through the examples:
- [3, 1, 2, 4, 5] represents 3 + 1*x + 2*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 5*x^4
  Derivative: 1 + 4*x + 12*x^2 + 20*x^3
  Which is [1, 4, 12, 20]

- [1, 2, 3] represents 1 + 2*x + 3*x^2
  Derivative: 2 + 6*x
  Which is [2, 6]

```python
def derivative(xs: list):
    """ xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
     Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
    >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
    [1, 4, 12, 20]
    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 6]
    """
    if len(xs) <= 1:
        return []
    
    result = []
    for i in range(1, len(xs)):
        result.append(i * xs[i])
    
    return result
```
