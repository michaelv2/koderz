```python
def count_upper(s):
    # Initialize the counter to zero
    count = 0
    # Iterate over the string s with step 2 (even indices)
    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):
        # Check if the character is an uppercase vowel
        if s[i] in 'AEIOU':
            # If it is, increment the counter
            count += 1
    # Return the final count
    return count
```
This function works by iterating over the string `s` with a step of 2 (which means it only checks even indices), and for each character in those positions, it checks if that character is an uppercase vowel. If it is, it increments a counter. Finally, it returns the count.

This function assumes that the input string `s` contains only alphabetic characters (no spaces or other non-alphabetical characters).
