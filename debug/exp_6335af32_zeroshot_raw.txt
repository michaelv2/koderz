To solve the problem of performing a binary XOR operation on two strings consisting only of 1s and 0s, we can follow these steps:

1. Ensure both strings are of the same length.
2. Iterate through each character of the strings.
3. Perform the XOR operation for each pair of characters.
4. Construct the resulting string from the XOR operations.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.
    """
    if len(a) != len(b):
        raise ValueError("Input strings must be of the same length")
    
    result = []
    for char_a, char_b in zip(a, b):
        # XOR operation: 1 if characters are different, 0 if they are the same
        xor_result = '1' if char_a != char_b else '0'
        result.append(xor_result)
    
    return ''.join(result)
```
