Looking at this problem, I need to check two conditions:
1. The string length is at least 3
2. Every 3 consecutive letters are distinct (no repeated letters in any group of 3 consecutive positions)

Let me trace through the examples:
- `is_happy(a)` → False (length < 3)
- `is_happy(aa)` → False (length < 3)  
- `is_happy(abcd)` → True (length ≥ 3, and "abc" and "bcd" both have distinct letters)
- `is_happy(aabb)` → False (even though length ≥ 3, "aab" has repeated 'a')
- `is_happy(adb)` → True (length ≥ 3, and all 3 letters are distinct)
- `is_happy(xyy)` → False (length ≥ 3, but "xyy" has repeated 'y')

```python
def is_happy(s):
    # Check if length is at least 3
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Check every group of 3 consecutive letters
    for i in range(len(s) - 2):
        # Get 3 consecutive letters
        three_letters = s[i:i+3]
        # Check if all 3 letters are distinct
        if len(set(three_letters)) != 3:
            return False
    
    return True
```
