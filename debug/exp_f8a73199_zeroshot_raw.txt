Let me reason through this problem:

1. I need to count how many times a substring appears in a string
2. The key requirement is to count **overlapping cases**
3. For example, in 'aaaa' looking for 'aa': positions 0-1, 1-2, 2-3 give us 3 occurrences

My approach:
- Iterate through the string with a sliding window
- At each position, check if the substring matches starting at that position
- Count all matches, including overlapping ones
- Handle edge cases: empty substring should return 0, empty string should return 0

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    if not substring or not string:
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(string) - len(substring) + 1):
        if string[i:i+len(substring)] == substring:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```
