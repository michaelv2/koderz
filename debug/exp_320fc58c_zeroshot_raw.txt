 The problem is asking to sort the even indexed elements of a list while keeping the odd indexed elements at their original positions. To solve this, we can follow these steps:

1. Extract all the even indexed elements from the input list and store them in a separate list.
2. Sort this new list of even indexed elements.
3. Replace the even indexed elements in the original list with the sorted ones.
4. Return the modified list.

Here is the Python function that implements this solution:

```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    # Extract all the even indexed elements
    evens = [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 2)]
    # Sort the even indexed elements
    evens.sort()
    # Replace the even indexed elements in the original list with the sorted ones
    for i in range(len(evens)):
        l[i*2] = evens[i]
    return l
```
