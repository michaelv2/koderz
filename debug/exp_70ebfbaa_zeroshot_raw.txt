```python
import re

def fix_spaces(text):
    # Replace all spaces with underscores
    text = text.replace(' ', '_')
    
    # If there are more than 2 consecutive underscores, replace them with -
    text = re.sub(r'_{3,}', '-', text)
    
    return text
```
This function first replaces all spaces in the input string with underscores. Then it uses a regular expression to find any sequence of 3 or more underscores and replace them with a single dash. This ensures that if there are multiple consecutive spaces, they will be replaced by a single dash. The result is then returned.

Note: This function assumes that the input string does not start or end with a space. If it could have leading or trailing spaces, you would need to add additional logic to handle those cases.
