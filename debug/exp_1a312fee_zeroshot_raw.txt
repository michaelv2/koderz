The problem is asking to calculate the total number of possible collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight line. Since each car from one set will collide with every car from the other set, the total number of collisions would be n*n (where n is the number of cars).

Here's a Python function that implements this:

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    return n * n
```
