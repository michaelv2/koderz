Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Start with a balance of 0
2. Process each operation (add it to the balance)
3. Check if the balance ever goes below 0
4. Return True if it does, False otherwise

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[1, 2, 3]`: balance goes 0 → 1 → 3 → 6, never below 0, return False ✓
- `[1, 2, -4, 5]`: balance goes 0 → 1 → 3 → -1 (below 0!), return True ✓

```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
