```python
def closest_integer(value):
    value = float(value)
    if value >= 0:
        return int(value + 0.5)
    else:
        return int(value - 0.5)
```

This function works by first converting the input string to a floating point number, then adding or subtracting 0.5 depending on whether the number is positive or negative. This has the effect of rounding towards zero (away from zero for negative numbers), as desired. The result is then converted back to an integer and returned.

This function assumes that the input string can be successfully converted to a floating point number, which should always be true if it was generated by Python's str() function on a numeric value. If this assumption does not hold, you would need to add error checking code to handle invalid inputs.
