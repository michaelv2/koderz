Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Find the word with the maximum number of unique characters
2. If there's a tie, return the lexicographically smallest one

Let me trace through the examples:
- `["name", "of", "string"]`: "name" has 4 unique chars, "of" has 2, "string" has 6 → "string"
- `["name", "enam", "game"]`: all have 4 unique chars → "enam" (lexicographically smallest)
- `["aaa", "bb", "cc"]`: all have 1 unique char → "aaa" (lexicographically smallest)

My approach:
1. For each word, count unique characters using `len(set(word))`
2. Find the maximum unique character count
3. Among words with maximum count, select the lexicographically smallest

```python
def find_max(words):
    max_unique = max(len(set(word)) for word in words)
    candidates = [word for word in words if len(set(word)) == max_unique]
    return min(candidates)
```
