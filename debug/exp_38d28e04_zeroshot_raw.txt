 The problem is about creating two functions: one for encoding and another for decoding a given string based on a cyclic pattern. To solve this, we can create an `encode_cyclic` function that cycles groups of three characters and a `decode_cyclic` function to reverse the encoding process.

Here's how I plan to implement these functions:

1. For the `encode_cyclic` function:
   - Split the input string into groups of three characters. If the last group has fewer than three characters, keep it as is.
   - Cycle each group by moving the first character to the end of the group.
   - Join all the groups back together and return the encoded string.

2. For the `decode_cyclic` function:
   - Split the input string into groups of three characters. If the last group has fewer than three characters, keep it as is.
   - Decode each group by moving the last character to the beginning of the group.
   - Join all the groups back together and return the decoded string.

Now, let's implement these functions in Python:

```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    # Split string into groups of three characters
    groups = [s[i:i+3] for i in range(0, len(s), 3)]
    # Cycle elements in each group
    encoded_groups = [group[-1] + group[:-1] if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(encoded_groups)

def decode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    # Split string into groups of three characters
    groups = [s[i:i+3] for i in range(0, len(s), 3)]
    # Decode each group by moving the last character to the beginning
    decoded_groups = [group[1:] + group[0] if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(decoded_groups)
```
