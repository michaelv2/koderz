To solve the problem of finding the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime, we need to follow these steps:

1. Generate Fibonacci numbers.
2. Check if each Fibonacci number is prime.
3. Keep track of how many prime Fibonacci numbers have been found until we reach the n-th one.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def is_prime(num: int) -> bool:
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def prime_fib(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime."""
    fib1, fib2 = 0, 1
    count = 0
    
    while True:
        fib_next = fib1 + fib2
        if is_prime(fib_next):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return fib_next
        fib1, fib2 = fib2, fib_next
```

This code defines a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime and the main function `prime_fib` to find the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime. The `prime_fib` function uses a loop to generate Fibonacci numbers and checks each one for primality until it finds the n-th prime Fibonacci number.
