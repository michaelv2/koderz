To solve this problem, we need to implement a function `sum_product` that takes a list of integers and returns a tuple containing the sum and the product of all the integers in the list. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Handle the empty list case**: If the input list is empty, the sum should be 0 and the product should be 1.
2. **Calculate the sum**: We can use Python's built-in `sum()` function to calculate the sum of all integers in the list.
3. **Calculate the product**: For the product, we need to initialize a variable to 1 (since multiplying by 1 does not change the value) and then iterate through the list, multiplying each element with this variable.

Let's implement this logic in the function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not numbers:
        return (0, 1)
    
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    total_product = 1
    for number in numbers:
        total_product *= number
    
    return (total_sum, total_product)
```

This function first checks if the list is empty and returns `(0, 1)` if true. Otherwise, it calculates the sum using `sum()` and iterates through the list to calculate the product. Finally, it returns a tuple containing both the sum and the product.
