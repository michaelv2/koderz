To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to make all elements of `lst1` even by exchanging elements with `lst2`. The key observation is that for each odd number in `lst1`, there must be an even number in `lst2` that can be swapped. If the count of odd numbers in `lst1` is less than or equal to the count of even numbers in `lst2`, then it's possible to perform the swaps needed to make all elements in `lst1` even.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    # Count the number of odd numbers in lst1
    odd_count_lst1 = sum(1 for x in lst1 if x % 2 != 0)
    # Count the number of even numbers in lst2
    even_count_lst2 = sum(1 for x in lst2 if x % 2 == 0)
    
    # If there are enough even numbers in lst2 to replace all odd numbers in lst1, return "YES"
    if odd_count_lst1 <= even_count_lst2:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```
