 The problem is about finding three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero. To solve this, we can iterate through all possible combinations of three numbers from the list and check if their sum equals zero. If such a combination is found, return True; otherwise, return False after checking all combinations.

Here's my plan:
1. Define a function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input.
2. Iterate through the list using three nested loops to generate all possible combinations of three numbers.
3. Check if the sum of these three numbers equals zero. If so, return True.
4. After checking all combinations, if no combination sums to zero, return False.

Now I'll implement this in Python:

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    n = len(l)
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
            for k in range(j + 1, n):
                if l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0:
                    return True
    return False
```
