 The problem is about calculating the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides. If the three sides form a valid triangle (i.e., the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side), we should return the area rounded to 2 decimal points. Otherwise, we should return -1.

Here's how I plan to solve this problem:
1. Check if the given lengths can form a valid triangle by verifying that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If not, return -1.
2. Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle as the average of its three sides.
3. Use Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle using the semi-perimeter and the lengths of the three sides.
4. Round the calculated area to 2 decimal points and return it.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
import math

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    # Check if the given lengths can form a valid triangle
    if (a + b <= c) or (b + c <= a) or (c + a <= b):
        return -1

    # Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle
    s = (a + b + c) / 2

    # Use Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

    # Round the calculated area to 2 decimal points and return it
    return round(area, 2)
```
