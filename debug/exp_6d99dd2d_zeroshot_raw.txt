To solve this problem, we need to identify all integer palindromes within the range from 1 to n (inclusive) and count how many of them are even and how many are odd.

A number is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11 are palindromes.

We can iterate through each number in the range, check if it is a palindrome by converting it to a string and comparing it to its reverse. Then we can classify it as even or odd and update our respective counters.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        str_i = str(i)
        if str_i == str_i[::-1]:  # Check if the number is a palindrome
            if i % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1
    
    return (even_count, odd_count)
```
