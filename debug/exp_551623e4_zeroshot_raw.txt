 The problem is about writing a Python function that takes a string as input and replaces all spaces with underscores. If the string has more than 2 consecutive spaces, those consecutive spaces should be replaced with a single hyphen.

Here's how I plan to solve this:
1. Use the `re` module in Python to find patterns of multiple spaces in the input text.
2. Replace all single spaces with underscores using the `replace()` function.
3. Replace all consecutive spaces found in step 1 with a hyphen.
4. Return the modified string as output.

Now, let's implement this plan in Python code:

```python
import re

def fix_spaces(text):
    # Replace multiple spaces with '-'
    text = re.sub(' {2,}', '-', text)
    # Replace single spaces with '_'
    text = text.replace(' ', '_')
    return text
```
