 The problem is about calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a given list of numbers. To solve this, we first calculate the mean of the numbers and then find the average absolute difference between each number and the mean.

Here's how I plan to implement the function:
1. Calculate the mean of the input numbers by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count of numbers.
2. For each number in the list, calculate the absolute difference from the mean.
3. Find the average of these absolute differences, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).

Now I'll write the Python function to solve this problem.
```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    n = len(numbers)
    mean = sum(numbers) / n
    mad = sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / n
    return mad
```
