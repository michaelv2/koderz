 The problem requires us to square each number in the list after rounding it up to the nearest integer and then summing all these squared numbers. Here's how I plan to solve this:

1. Iterate over each element in the given list.
2. Round up each element to the nearest integer using the `math.ceil` function.
3. Square each rounded number.
4. Sum up all the squared numbers and return the result.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
import math

def sum_squares(lst):
    return sum([math.ceil(x) ** 2 for x in lst])
```
