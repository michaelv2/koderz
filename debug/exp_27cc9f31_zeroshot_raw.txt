 The problem is about a hungry rabbit that has already eaten a certain number of carrots and needs to eat more to complete its meals. The task is to write a Python function that takes the number of carrots the rabbit has eaten, the number it needs to eat, and the remaining carrots in stock as input. The function should return an array containing the total number of carrots eaten after the meal and the number of carrots left after the meal. If there are not enough remaining carrots, the rabbit will eat all of them but still be hungry.

Here's my approach to solve this problem:
1. Calculate the total number of carrots the rabbit needs to eat by adding the number it has already eaten and the number it needs.
2. Check if there are enough remaining carrots for the rabbit to eat. If not, set the total number of carrots eaten to be equal to the sum of the carrots it had and the remaining carrots. Set the remaining carrots to 0.
3. If there are enough remaining carrots, set the total number of carrots eaten to be equal to the sum of the carrots it had and the number it needs to eat. Subtract this amount from the remaining carrots to get the new number of remaining carrots.
4. Return a list containing the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining carrots.

Here's my complete function implementation:
```python
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    total_needed = number + need
    if total_needed > remaining:
        return [number + remaining, 0]
    else:
        return [total_needed, remaining - total_needed]
```
