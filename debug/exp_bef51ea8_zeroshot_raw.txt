To solve this problem, we need to break down the task into several steps:

1. Split the input string `s` into individual words.
2. Define what constitutes a consonant (all alphabetic characters except for the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').
3. For each word, count the number of consonants it contains.
4. Collect and return the words that have exactly `n` consonants.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def select_words(s, n):
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    words_with_n_consonants = []
    
    for word in s.split():
        consonant_count = sum(1 for char in word if char.isalpha() and char not in vowels)
        if consonant_count == n:
            words_with_n_consonants.append(word)
    
    return words_with_n_consonants
```
