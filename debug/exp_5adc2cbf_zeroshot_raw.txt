Looking at this problem, I need to find a zero of a polynomial given its coefficients.

Key observations:
1. The polynomial is: `xs[0] + xs[1]*x + xs[2]*x^2 + ... + xs[n]*x^n`
2. I need to find `x` such that `poly(x) = 0`
3. The input has an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient is guaranteed to exist, which guarantees a solution exists
4. I only need to return one zero point

Approach:
Since we need to find a root of the polynomial, I can use a numerical method. The most reliable approach for this would be:
- Newton-Raphson method (requires derivative)
- Bisection method (requires bracketing)
- A simple numerical library like scipy

Let me use Newton-Raphson method which is efficient and requires:
1. The function `poly(x)` - already provided
2. The derivative `poly'(x)` - which I need to compute

For a polynomial `f(x) = xs[0] + xs[1]*x + xs[2]*x^2 + ...`, the derivative is:
`f'(x) = xs[1] + 2*xs[2]*x + 3*xs[3]*x^2 + ...`

Newton-Raphson: `x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)`

I'll start with an initial guess and iterate until convergence.

```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def find_zero(xs: list):
    """ xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only only zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
