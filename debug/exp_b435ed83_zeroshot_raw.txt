To solve the problem of calculating the area of a triangle given its base length and height, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

Here's the Python function implementation:

```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

This function takes two parameters: `a` (the base length) and `h` (the height), and returns the calculated area of the triangle using the formula provided.
