Looking at this problem step by step:

1. First, I need to filter integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive
2. Then sort those integers
3. Reverse the sorted array
4. Replace each digit with its corresponding word name

Let me trace through the example:
- Input: [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]
- Filter (1-9): [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3] (all are in range)
- Sort: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
- Reverse: [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]
- Replace with names: ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"]

For edge cases:
- Empty array: return empty array
- Numbers outside 1-9: ignore them (like -1 and 55 in the third example)

```python
def by_length(arr):
    # Mapping from numbers to their word representations
    num_to_word = {
        1: "One",
        2: "Two", 
        3: "Three",
        4: "Four",
        5: "Five",
        6: "Six",
        7: "Seven",
        8: "Eight",
        9: "Nine"
    }
    
    # Filter numbers between 1 and 9 inclusive
    filtered_arr = [num for num in arr if 1 <= num <= 9]
    
    # Sort the filtered array
    filtered_arr.sort()
    
    # Reverse the sorted array
    filtered_arr.reverse()
    
    # Replace each number with its word representation
    result = [num_to_word[num] for num in filtered_arr]
    
    return result
```
