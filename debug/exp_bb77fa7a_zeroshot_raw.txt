Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Filter out strings with odd lengths (keep only even-length strings)
2. Sort the remaining strings by length (ascending)
3. For strings of the same length, sort alphabetically

Let me trace through the examples:
- `["aa", "a", "aaa"]`: "aa" (length 2), "a" (length 1), "aaa" (length 3) → keep "aa" → return ["aa"]
- `["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]`: "ab" (length 2), "a" (length 1), "aaa" (length 3), "cd" (length 2) → keep "ab", "cd" → sort by length then alphabetically → ["ab", "cd"]

```python
def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    # Filter out strings with odd lengths (keep only even lengths)
    even_length_strings = [s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 == 0]
    
    # Sort by length first, then alphabetically
    return sorted(even_length_strings, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))
```
