 The problem requires us to find the second smallest element in a given list of integers. If there is no such element (i.e., the list has less than 2 unique elements), we should return None.

Here's how I plan to solve this:
1. First, I will remove any duplicates from the list by converting it into a set and then back into a list. This is because a set in Python automatically removes duplicate values.
2. Then, I will sort the list in ascending order.
3. If the length of the sorted list is less than 2, I will return None as there's no second smallest element. Otherwise, I will return the element at index 1 (which is the second smallest element).

Now, let me write the Python function for this:

```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    lst = list(set(lst))
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    else:
        lst.sort()
        return lst[1]
```
