To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Generate a list of prime numbers less than 100**: Since `a` is less than 100, any prime factor of `a` must also be less than 100.
2. **Check all combinations of three primes**: We need to check if there are any three primes whose product equals `a`.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    def is_prime(n):
        """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    primes = [i for i in range(2, 100) if is_prime(i)]

    for i in range(len(primes)):
        for j in range(i, len(primes)):
            for k in range(j, len(primes)):
                if primes[i] * primes[j] * primes[k] == a:
                    return True
    return False
```

### Explanation:

1. **Prime Number Generation**:
   - The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.
   - We generate a list of prime numbers less than 100 using a list comprehension.

2. **Combination Check**:
   - We use three nested loops to iterate through all combinations of three primes.
   - If the product of any combination equals `a`, we return `True`.
   - If no such combination is found, we return `False`.

This approach ensures that we check all possible products of three prime numbers less than 100 and determine if they match the given number `a`.
