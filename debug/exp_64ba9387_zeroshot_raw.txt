 The problem is about determining whether a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To solve this problem, we can iterate from 2 to the square root of the number and check if it divides the number evenly. If it does, then the number is not prime. Otherwise, it is prime.

Here's the Python function that implements this logic:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
