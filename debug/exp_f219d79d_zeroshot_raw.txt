Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Find all palindromes from 1 to n (inclusive)
2. Count how many are even and how many are odd
3. Return the counts as a tuple (even_count, odd_count)

Let me break this down:
- A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards
- For each number from 1 to n, I need to check if it's a palindrome
- Then classify it as even or odd and count accordingly

```python
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    def is_palindrome(num):
        s = str(num)
        return s == s[::-1]
    
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if is_palindrome(i):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1
    
    return (even_count, odd_count)
```
