To solve this problem efficiently, especially for large values of `n`, we can use Python's built-in pow function with three arguments: `pow(x, y, z)` computes \( x^y \mod z \) using an efficient algorithm that avoids the pitfalls of computing large intermediate results.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def modp(n: int, p: int):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
