 The problem is asking to filter out the positive numbers from a given list. To solve this, I will use a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the list and include it in the new list only if it's greater than 0.

Here's my solution:

```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [num for num in l if num > 0]
```
