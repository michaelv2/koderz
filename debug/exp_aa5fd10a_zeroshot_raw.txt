To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Iterate through each element in the list.
2. Round each element up to the nearest integer using the `math.ceil` function.
3. Square the rounded integer.
4. Sum all the squared values.
5. Return the sum.

Here's the implementation of the `sum_squares` function:

```python
import math

def sum_squares(lst):
    return sum(math.ceil(x) ** 2 for x in lst)
```
