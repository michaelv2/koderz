Let me think through this problem:

1. I need to check if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold
2. "Closer than threshold" means the absolute difference between them is less than the threshold
3. I need to compare all pairs of numbers
4. Return True if any pair has distance < threshold, False otherwise

Approach:
- Iterate through each pair of numbers in the list
- Calculate the absolute difference between each pair
- If any difference is less than the threshold, return True
- If no such pair is found, return False

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
