To solve this problem, we need to generate Fibonacci numbers and check if they are prime until we find the n-th prime Fibonacci number. Here's how I plan to approach it:

1. Generate Fibonacci numbers starting from 2.
2. Check if each Fibonacci number is prime.
3. Keep a count of how many prime Fibonacci numbers have been found.
4. Stop when the count reaches `n` and return that Fibonacci number.

To implement this, we'll need:
- A function to generate Fibonacci numbers.
- A function to check for primality.
- A loop to combine these two functionalities until we find the desired n-th prime Fibonacci number.

Let's write the code:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def prime_fib(n: int):
    fib1, fib2 = 1, 1
    count = 0
    while True:
        fib_next = fib1 + fib2
        if is_prime(fib_next):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return fib_next
        fib1, fib2 = fib2, fib_next

```
