 The problem requires us to swap the case of all letters and replace vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of it in the English alphabet. To solve this, we can iterate over each character in the message, check if it's a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase), and if so, replace it with the corresponding letter two positions ahead. If it's not a vowel, we simply swap its case.

Here is my plan:
1. Define a function `encode` that takes a string `message` as input.
2. Initialize an empty string `result` to store the encoded message.
3. Iterate over each character in the `message`.
4. Check if the current character is a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase). If it is, replace it with the corresponding letter two positions ahead in the English alphabet and append it to `result`.
5. If the current character is not a vowel, swap its case and append it to `result`.
6. Return the encoded message stored in `result`.

Now I'll write the Python code for this function.
```python
def encode(message):
    result = ''
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    for char in message:
        if char in vowels:
            index = (alphabet.index(char) + 2) % len(alphabet)
            result += alphabet[index]
        else:
            result += char.swapcase()
    return result
```
