 The problem requires sorting a list of integers based on the sum of their digits. If there are multiple items with the same sum of digits, they should be ordered based on their original index.

Here's my plan:
1. Define a helper function to calculate the sum of digits for an integer.
2. Use Python's built-in `sorted` function to sort the list. The key for sorting will be a tuple where the first element is the sum of digits and the second element is the index in the original list.
3. Return the sorted list.

Now, let's implement this plan:

```python
def order_by_points(nums):
    def digit_sum(n):
        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(n)))

    return [x for _, x in sorted((digit_sum(num), i, num) for i, num in enumerate(nums))]
```
