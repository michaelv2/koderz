To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Remove all characters from string `s` that are present in string `c`.
2. Check if the resulting string is a palindrome.
3. Return a tuple containing the resulting string and a boolean indicating whether it is a palindrome.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    # Remove characters from s that are present in c
    result = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in c)
    
    # Check if the result string is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = result == result[::-1]
    
    return (result, is_palindrome)
```

This function first uses a generator expression to create a new string `result` that contains only the characters from `s` that are not in `c`. It then checks if `result` is equal to its reverse (`result[::-1]`) to determine if it is a palindrome. Finally, it returns a tuple containing `result` and the boolean value of `is_palindrome`.
