Let me reason through this problem:

1. We need to determine if we can exchange elements between `lst1` and `lst2` to make all elements in `lst1` even.
2. Key insight: We can exchange any elements we want, so what matters is whether there are enough even numbers in total (across both lists) to fill all positions in `lst1`.
3. If the total count of even numbers in both lists is at least the length of `lst1`, then we can definitely exchange elements to make `lst1` all even.
4. We should count:
   - Total even numbers available in `lst1` and `lst2` combined
   - The length of `lst1` (how many even numbers we need)

If `even_count >= len(lst1)`, we can make `lst1` all even by swapping odd numbers from `lst1` with even numbers from `lst2`.

```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    """Determines whether it is possible to exchange elements between lst1 and lst2
    to make lst1 contain only even numbers.
    """
    # Count total even numbers available in both lists
    even_count = sum(1 for num in lst1 + lst2 if num % 2 == 0)
    
    # We need at least len(lst1) even numbers to fill lst1
    if even_count >= len(lst1):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```
