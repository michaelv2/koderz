To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Filter out strings with odd lengths.
2. Sort the remaining strings first by their length and then alphabetically if they have the same length.

Here's the Python function that implements this logic:

```python
def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    # Filter out strings with odd lengths
    filtered_lst = [word for word in lst if len(word) % 2 == 0]
    
    # Sort the list by length, and then alphabetically
    sorted_lst = sorted(filtered_lst, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))
    
    return sorted_lst
```

This function first filters out strings with odd lengths using a list comprehension. Then, it sorts the filtered list using the `sorted` function with a custom key that sorts primarily by length and secondarily alphabetically.
