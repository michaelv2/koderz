I need to find the largest prime factor of a given number n.

**Reasoning:**
1. I'll use trial division to find prime factors
2. Start with the smallest prime (2) and divide out all factors of 2
3. Then check odd numbers starting from 3
4. Only need to check up to √n because if n has a factor greater than √n, it must also have a corresponding factor less than √n
5. Keep track of the largest prime factor found
6. Any remaining value > 1 after the loop is itself a prime factor

**Approach:**
- Divide out all factors of 2
- Then check odd divisors from 3 onwards up to √n
- The last divisor found (or n itself if it's still > 1) is the largest prime factor

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n: int):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime."""
    largest = -1
    
    # Check for factor 2
    while n % 2 == 0:
        largest = 2
        n = n // 2
    
    # Check for odd factors from 3 onwards
    divisor = 3
    while divisor * divisor <= n:
        while n % divisor == 0:
            largest = divisor
            n = n // divisor
        divisor += 2
    
    # If n is still greater than 1, then it's a prime factor
    if n > 1:
        largest = n
    
    return largest
```
