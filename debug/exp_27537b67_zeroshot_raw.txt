To solve the problem of calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a given list of numbers, we can break down the task into a few clear steps:

1. **Calculate the mean** of the input list.
2. **Compute the absolute deviations**: For each number in the list, calculate the absolute difference between that number and the mean.
3. **Calculate the average** of these absolute deviations to get the MAD.

Let's implement this step-by-step in Python:

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    if not numbers:
        return 0.0  # Return 0 for an empty list to avoid division by zero
    
    # Step 1: Calculate the mean of the numbers
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the absolute deviations from the mean
    absolute_deviations = [abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the mean of these absolute deviations
    mad = sum(absolute_deviations) / len(absolute_deviations)
    
    return mad
```

This function first checks if the list is empty to avoid division by zero. It then calculates the mean, computes the absolute deviations from this mean, and finally returns the average of these deviations as the Mean Absolute Deviation.
