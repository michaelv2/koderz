To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. A straightforward approach is to check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If no divisors are found, the number is prime.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```
