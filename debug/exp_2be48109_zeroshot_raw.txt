To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to concatenate two given strings of parentheses in some order such that the resulting string is balanced. A string is considered balanced if every opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')'.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this:

1. **Check Both Possible Concatenations**: We need to check both possible concatenations of the two strings: `str1 + str2` and `str2 + str1`.
2. **Balance Check Function**: Create a helper function to check if a given string is balanced.
3. **Return Result**: If either concatenated string is balanced, return 'Yes'. Otherwise, return 'No'.

Let's implement this:

```python
def is_balanced(s):
    balance = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    return balance == 0

def match_parens(lst):
    str1, str2 = lst
    if is_balanced(str1 + str2) or is_balanced(str2 + str1):
        return 'Yes'
    else:
        return 'No'
```

### Explanation:

1. **is_balanced Function**:
   - This function iterates through each character in the string.
   - It maintains a balance counter that increments for an opening parenthesis '(' and decrements for a closing parenthesis ')'.
   - If at any point the balance goes negative, it means there are more closing parentheses than opening ones up to that point, so the string is not balanced.
   - Finally, if the balance is zero after processing all characters, the string is balanced.

2. **match_parens Function**:
   - It takes a list of two strings `lst`.
   - It checks both possible concatenations (`str1 + str2` and `str2 + str1`) using the `is_balanced` function.
   - If either concatenated string is balanced, it returns 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

This approach ensures that we correctly determine if there's a way to concatenate the two strings such that the resulting string is balanced.
