Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Check if the last character is alphabetical
2. Ensure it's NOT part of a word (meaning it should be followed by a space or be isolated)
3. Handle edge cases like empty strings

Let me trace through the examples:
- "apple pie" → last char is 'e', it's a letter but it's part of the word "pie" → False
- "apple pi e" → last char is 'e', it's a letter and it's isolated (preceded by space) → True
- "apple pi e " → last char is a space (not a letter) → False
- "" → empty string → False

The key insight: the last character should be a letter AND there should be a space before it (to ensure it's not part of a word), OR it should be a single character word.

Actually, re-reading: "is not a part of a word" means the letter should be by itself, separated by spaces on both sides (or at least on the left side since it's the last character).

So the logic is:
1. String must not be empty
2. Last character must be alphabetical
3. If string length is 1, return True (single letter, not part of a word)
4. If string length > 1, the character before the last character must be a space

```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    # Empty string
    if len(txt) == 0:
        return False
    
    # Last character must be alphabetical
    if not txt[-1].isalpha():
        return False
    
    # If string has only one character and it's a letter
    if len(txt) == 1:
        return True
    
    # For strings longer than 1 char, the character before last must be a space
    # to ensure the last letter is not part of a word
    return txt[-2] == ' '
```
