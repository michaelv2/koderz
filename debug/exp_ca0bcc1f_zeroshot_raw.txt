Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Find all integers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13
2. Count how many times the digit 7 appears in those numbers
3. Return that count

Let me trace through the examples:
- `fizz_buzz(50)`: Numbers < 50 divisible by 11 or 13: 11, 13, 22, 26, 33, 39, 44, 48. None contain '7', so return 0
- `fizz_buzz(78)`: Numbers < 78 divisible by 11 or 13: 11, 13, 22, 26, 33, 39, 44, 48, 55, 57, 66, 68, 77. Among these, 57 has one '7' and 77 has two '7's, so total is 3. Wait, the expected output is 2, so let me recheck...

Actually, let me be more careful. Looking at 77: it's divisible by 11 (11×7=77) and contains two 7s. Let me recheck the example more carefully.

Let me re-read: "Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13."

For `fizz_buzz(78)`, the numbers less than 78 divisible by 11 or 13 are:
11, 13, 22, 26, 33, 39, 44, 48, 55, 57, 66, 68, 77

Counting 7s:
- 57: one 7
- 77: two 7s
Total: 3

But expected is 2. Let me check if 77 is divisible by 13: 77 ÷ 13 = 5.92... No, 77 is divisible by 11 only.
Let me check 57: 57 ÷ 13 = 4.38... No, 57 is not divisible by 13. 57 ÷ 11 = 5.18... No, 57 is not divisible by 11.

Wait, let me list all numbers < 78 divisible by 11 or 13:
- Divisible by 11: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77
- Divisible by 13: 13, 26, 39, 52, 65

Combined and sorted: 11, 13, 22, 26, 33, 39, 44, 52, 55, 65, 66, 77

Counting 7s:
- 11: no 7
- 13: no 7  
- 22: no 7
- 26: no 7
- 33: no 7
- 39: no 7
- 44: no 7
- 52: no 7
- 55: no 7
- 65: no 7
- 66: no 7
- 77: two 7s

This gives 2, which matches the expected output for fizz_buzz(78).

Let me double-check fizz_buzz(79):
Numbers < 79 divisible by 11 or 13: 11, 13, 22, 26, 33, 39, 44, 52, 55, 65, 66, 77
Counting 7s: 77 has two 7s, so total is 2. But expected is 3.

Wait, let me recheck the problem statement and examples more carefully.

Actually, let me just implement the logic and test it:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    >>> fizz_buzz(50)
    0
    >>> fizz_buzz(78)
    2
    >>> fizz_buzz(79)
    3
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            count += str(i).count('7')
    return count
```
