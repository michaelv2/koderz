Looking at this problem, I need to implement a function that filters a list of strings to only include those that start with a given prefix.

Let me analyze the requirements:
1. Take a list of strings and a prefix string as input
2. Return a new list containing only strings that start with the given prefix
3. Handle edge cases like empty lists

The solution is straightforward - I'll iterate through the input list and use Python's built-in `str.startswith()` method to check if each string starts with the prefix.

```python
from typing import List


def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.
    >>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
    ['abc', 'array']
    """
    return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]
```
