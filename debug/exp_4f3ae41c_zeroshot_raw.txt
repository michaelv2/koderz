Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Identify indices that are divisible by 3 (0, 3, 6, 9, ...)
2. Extract the values at those indices from the original list
3. Sort those values
4. Put the sorted values back at the same indices
5. Keep all other indices unchanged

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[1, 2, 3]`: indices 0 and 3 (but 3 is out of bounds), so only index 0. Values at index 0: [1]. Sorted: [1]. Result: [1, 2, 3]
- `[5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]`: indices 0, 3, 6. Values at these indices: [5, 4, 2]. Sorted: [2, 4, 5]. Result: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """
    # Create a copy of the original list
    result = l.copy()
    
    # Extract values at indices divisible by 3
    third_elements = []
    third_indices = []
    
    for i in range(0, len(l), 3):
        third_elements.append(l[i])
        third_indices.append(i)
    
    # Sort the extracted elements
    third_elements.sort()
    
    # Put the sorted elements back at their respective indices
    for i, index in enumerate(third_indices):
        result[index] = third_elements[i]
    
    return result
```
