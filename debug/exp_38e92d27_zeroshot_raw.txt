To solve this problem, we need to find the two numbers in the list that have the smallest difference between them and return them in ascending order. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Sort the list of numbers. This will allow us to only compare adjacent elements to find the closest pair.
2. Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum difference found and the corresponding pair of numbers.
3. Iterate through the sorted list, comparing each pair of adjacent numbers.
4. If a smaller difference is found, update the minimum difference and the pair of numbers.
5. Return the pair of numbers in ascending order.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (None, None)
    
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        diff = abs(sorted_numbers[i] - sorted_numbers[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[i], sorted_numbers[i + 1])
    
    return closest_pair
```
