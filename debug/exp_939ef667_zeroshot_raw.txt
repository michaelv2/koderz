Let me reason through this:

1. I need to remove all elements that occur more than once in the list
2. I need to keep the order of remaining elements the same as in the input
3. From the example: [1, 2, 3, 2, 4] → [1, 3, 4]
   - 1 appears once, keep it
   - 2 appears twice, remove all occurrences
   - 3 appears once, keep it
   - 4 appears once, keep it

Approach:
1. First, count the frequency of each element
2. Then, iterate through the original list and keep only elements that appear exactly once
3. This preserves the original order

```python
def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
    from collections import Counter
    
    count = Counter(numbers)
    return [num for num in numbers if count[num] == 1]
```
