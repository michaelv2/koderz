Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Check if the last character of a string is alphabetical
2. Check if that last alphabetical character is not part of a word (i.e., it's preceded by a space or is the only character)
3. Return True only if both conditions are met

Let me trace through the examples:
- "apple pie" → last char is 'e', but it's part of "pie" which is a word → False
- "apple pi e" → last char is 'e', it's preceded by a space → True  
- "apple pi e " → last char is space → False
- "" → empty string → False

```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    if not txt:
        return False
    
    if not txt[-1].isalpha():
        return False
    
    # If string has only one character and it's a letter, return True
    if len(txt) == 1:
        return True
    
    # Check if the character before the last one is a space
    # This would mean the last letter is not part of a word
    return txt[-2] == ' '
```
