To solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct characters in a given string, ignoring case sensitivity. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Convert the string to lowercase to ensure that character comparison is case-insensitive.
2. Use a set to store unique characters since sets automatically handle duplicates.
3. Iterate through the string and add each character (in lowercase) to the set.
4. The size of the set will give us the number of distinct characters.

```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of """
    # Convert the string to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity
    lower_string = string.lower()
    
    # Use a set to store unique characters
    unique_chars = set(lower_string)
    
    # Return the number of distinct characters
    return len(unique_chars)
```
