Looking at this problem, I need to verify that brackets are properly balanced.

The key insights are:
1. At no point should we have more closing brackets than opening brackets (going left to right)
2. At the end, the count of opening and closing brackets must be equal

I can track this with a counter:
- Increment for each opening bracket "("
- Decrement for each closing bracket ")"
- Return False if counter goes negative (more closing than opening)
- Return True only if counter ends at 0 (all brackets matched)

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    count = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == "(":
            count += 1
        elif char == ")":
            count -= 1
        
        if count < 0:
            return False
    
    return count == 0
```
