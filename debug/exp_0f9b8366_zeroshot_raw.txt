Let me reason through this:

1. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself
2. Key observations:
   - Numbers less than 2 are not prime
   - 2 is prime
   - Even numbers (except 2) are not prime
   - For odd numbers, we only need to check divisibility up to √n
   - We only need to check odd divisors since we already ruled out even divisors

3. Algorithm:
   - Handle edge cases (n < 2)
   - Check if n is 2 (prime)
   - Check if n is even (not prime)
   - For odd n, check divisibility by odd numbers from 3 to √n

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    
    # Check odd divisors up to sqrt(n)
    i = 3
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        i += 2
    
    return True
```
