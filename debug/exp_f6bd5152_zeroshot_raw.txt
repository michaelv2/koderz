To solve this problem, we need to check if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring of the first word. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Generate all possible rotations of the second word.
2. Check if any of these rotations is a substring of the first word.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    # Function to generate all rotations of a string
    def rotations(s):
        return [s[i:] + s[:i] for i in range(len(s))]
    
    # Generate all rotations of the second word
    rotations_b = rotations(b)
    
    # Check if any rotation is a substring of the first word
    for rot in rotations_b:
        if rot in a:
            return True
    
    return False
```

This function first defines a helper function `rotations` that generates all possible rotations of a given string. Then, it uses this helper function to generate all rotations of the second word `b`. Finally, it checks if any of these rotations is a substring of the first word `a`. If so, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
