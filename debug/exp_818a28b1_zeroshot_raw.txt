 The problem is about creating a Python function that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive). To solve this, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

Here's the implementation of the `sum_to_n` function:

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    return n * (n + 1) // 2
```
