```python
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    def is_palindrome(num):
        return str(num) == str(num)[::-1]
    
    even, odd = 0, 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if is_palindrome(i):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                even += 1
            else:
                odd += 1
                
    return (even, odd)
```
This function works by iterating over all numbers from 1 to n and checking whether each number is a palindrome. If it is, the function then checks if the number is even or odd and increments the respective counter. The final result is returned as a tuple of two integers.
