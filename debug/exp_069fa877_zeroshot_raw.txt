 The problem is asking to extract the decimal part from a given positive floating point number. To solve this, we can use the modulo operator (%), which returns the remainder of the division operation. By taking the modulo of the number with 1, we can get the decimal part.

Here's the Python function that implements this:

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    return number % 1
```
