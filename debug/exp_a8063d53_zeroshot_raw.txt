I will maintain a counter: increment for '(' and decrement for ')'. If the counter ever goes negative or is non-zero at the end, the string is not correctly bracketed.

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "(" and ")".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
    """
    count = 0
    for ch in brackets:
        if ch == '(':
            count += 1
        elif ch == ')':
            count -= 1
        else:
            # if other characters appear, consider them invalid input;
            # treat as not correctly bracketed
            return False
        if count < 0:
            return False
    return count == 0
```
