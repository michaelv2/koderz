To solve this problem, we need to find the largest divisor of a given number `n` that is smaller than `n`. The approach involves iterating from `n-1` down to 1 and checking for divisibility. The first number that divides `n` evenly is our answer.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. Start with the largest possible candidate, which is `n-1`.
2. Check if this candidate divides `n` without leaving a remainder.
3. If it does, return this candidate as the result.
4. If not, decrement the candidate and repeat the process until you find such a number.

This approach ensures that we find the largest divisor smaller than `n` efficiently.

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n """
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```

This function will correctly find and return the largest divisor of `n` that is smaller than `n`.
