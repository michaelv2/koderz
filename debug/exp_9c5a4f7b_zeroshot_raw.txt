To solve this problem, we need to construct an algebraic expression using the given operators and operands, and then evaluate it. The key points are:

1. The `operator` list contains basic arithmetic operations.
2. The `operand` list contains non-negative integers.
3. The length of the `operator` list is one less than the length of the `operand` list.
4. We need to construct an expression by interleaving operators and operands, starting with an operand.

Given these points, we can iterate through the `operator` and `operand` lists to build the expression as a string and then evaluate it using Python's `eval` function.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    # Start with the first operand
    expression = str(operand[0])
    
    # Interleave operators and operands
    for i in range(len(operator)):
        expression += f" {operator[i]} {operand[i + 1]}"
    
    # Evaluate the constructed expression
    return eval(expression)
```
