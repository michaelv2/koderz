To solve this problem, we need to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive and return them as a single string with each number separated by a space. We can achieve this using Python's `range` function to generate the numbers and `join` method to concatenate them into a single string.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n + 1)))
```
