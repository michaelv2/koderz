Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Extract the number of apples from the string
2. Extract the number of oranges from the string
3. Subtract both from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes

The string format is consistent: "[number] apples and [number] oranges"

I can parse this by:
- Splitting the string to isolate the numbers
- Converting them to integers
- Subtracting from the total

```python
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    """
    Extract the number of apples and oranges from the string,
    then calculate mangoes as: total - apples - oranges
    """
    # Split the string and extract numbers
    parts = s.split()
    apples = int(parts[0])
    oranges = int(parts[3])
    
    # Calculate mangoes
    mangoes = n - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
