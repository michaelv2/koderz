Let me analyze this problem:

1. I need to sum elements that have "at most two digits" - meaning numbers from -99 to 99 (or 0 to 99 if we're thinking positive)
2. I only consider the first k elements of the array
3. A number has at most two digits if its absolute value is less than 100

For example, with `arr = [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9]` and `k = 4`:
- First 4 elements: [111, 21, 3, 4000]
- 111 has 3 digits (exclude)
- 21 has 2 digits (include) → sum = 21
- 3 has 1 digit (include) → sum = 21 + 3 = 24
- 4000 has 4 digits (exclude)
- Result: 24 ✓

The key is to check if the absolute value of each number is less than 100.

```python
def add_elements(arr, k):
    """
    Given a non-empty array of integers arr and an integer k, return
    the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr.
    """
    return sum(num for num in arr[:k] if abs(num) < 100)
```
