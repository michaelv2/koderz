To solve this problem, we need to ensure that every opening bracket `<` has a corresponding closing bracket `>`, and they are correctly nested. We can use a counter to keep track of the balance between opening and closing brackets as we iterate through the string.

Here's the reasoning:
1. Initialize a counter to zero.
2. Traverse each character in the string:
   - Increment the counter for every `<`.
   - Decrement the counter for every `>`.
3. If at any point the counter becomes negative, it means there is a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket, so we return False.
4. After processing all characters, if the counter is zero, it means all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets, so we return True. Otherwise, we return False.

Let's implement this logic in the function:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '>':
            balance -= 1
        # If balance is negative, there are more '>' than '<' at some point
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    # If balance is not zero, there are unmatched '<'
    return balance == 0
```
