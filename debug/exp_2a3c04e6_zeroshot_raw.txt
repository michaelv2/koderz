 The problem is about calculating the number of mangoes in a basket given a string representing the number of apples and oranges and an integer representing the total number of fruits in the basket. To solve this, we need to extract the numbers of apples and oranges from the string, convert them to integers, subtract their sum from the total number of fruits, and return the result.

Here's the Python function that implements this:

```python
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    # Extract numbers of apples and oranges from the string
    apple_str, orange_str = s.split('apples and')[0].strip(), s.split('oranges')[0].strip()

    # Convert strings to integers
    apples = int(apple_str)
    oranges = int(orange_str)

    # Calculate number of mangoes
    mangoes = n - apples - oranges

    return mangoes
```
