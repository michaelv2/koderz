I need to implement a function that sorts number words from 'zero' to 'nine' in ascending order.

Let me think through this step by step:

1. I need to parse the input string into individual number words
2. I need to map each word to its numeric value for sorting
3. I need to sort the words based on their numeric values
4. I need to return the sorted words as a space-delimited string

Here's my approach:
- Create a mapping from word to number
- Split the input string into words
- Sort the words based on their numeric values
- Join them back into a string

```python
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    # Create mapping from words to numbers
    word_to_num = {
        'zero': 0,
        'one': 1,
        'two': 2,
        'three': 3,
        'four': 4,
        'five': 5,
        'six': 6,
        'seven': 7,
        'eight': 8,
        'nine': 9
    }
    
    # Split the input string into words
    word_list = numbers.split()
    
    # Sort words based on their numeric values
    sorted_words = sorted(word_list, key=lambda word: word_to_num[word])
    
    # Join back into a space-delimited string
    return ' '.join(sorted_words)
```
