Looking at this problem, I need to find all prime factors of a number and return them in a list, with repetition based on how many times each prime divides the number.

My approach:
1. Start with the smallest prime (2) and divide the number by it as many times as possible, adding each division to the result
2. Move to the next potential prime (3, 5, 7, ...) and repeat
3. Only need to check up to √n since any factor larger than that would have already been paired with a smaller factor
4. If anything remains after checking all factors up to √n, it must be prime itself

Let me trace through an example:
- factorize(70): 70 is even → divide by 2 → [2], remaining 35. Not divisible by 2. Try 3: no. Try 5: yes → [2, 5], remaining 7. Try divisors up to √7 ≈ 2.6, nothing works. 7 remains, add it → [2, 5, 7] ✓

```python
def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    d = 2
    
    while d * d <= n:
        while n % d == 0:
            factors.append(d)
            n //= d
        d += 1
    
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    
    return factors
```
