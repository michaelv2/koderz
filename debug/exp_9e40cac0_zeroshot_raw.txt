```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    # Remove all characters from s that are present in c
    filtered_s = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in c)
    
    # Check if the filtered string is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = filtered_s == filtered_s[::-1]
    
    return (filtered_s, is_palindrome)
