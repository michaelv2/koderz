To solve this problem, we need to find the largest divisor of a given number `n` that is smaller than `n`. The approach involves iterating from `n-1` down to 1 and checking for divisibility. The first number that divides `n` evenly is the largest divisor smaller than `n`.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n """
    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```

This function iterates from `n-1` down to 1 and returns the first number that divides `n` without a remainder.
