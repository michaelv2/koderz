To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the first `k` elements of the array `arr`, check if each element has at most two digits (i.e., its absolute value is less than 100), and sum those elements that meet this criterion.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum.
2. Loop through the first `k` elements of the array.
3. For each element, check if it has at most two digits.
4. If it does, add it to the sum.
5. Return the final sum after the loop completes.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
def add_elements(arr, k):
    total = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if abs(arr[i]) < 100:
            total += arr[i]
    return total
```
