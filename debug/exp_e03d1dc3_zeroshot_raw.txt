To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that finds the maximum element in a given list. Python provides a built-in `max` function that can be used directly for this purpose. The function will take a list as an argument and return the maximum value found in that list.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
```
