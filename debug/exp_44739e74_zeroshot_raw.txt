 The problem is about filtering an input list of strings based on whether they contain a given substring. To solve this, we can iterate through the list and check if each string contains the substring using Python's built-in `in` operator. If it does, we add it to our result list.

Here is the complete function implementation:

```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:
    return [s for s in strings if substring in s]
```
