Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Handle empty array case - return None
2. Calculate the sum of magnitudes of all integers
3. Calculate the product of all signs (1, -1, or 0)
4. Multiply these two values together

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[1, 2, 2, -4]`: sum of magnitudes = 1+2+2+4 = 9, signs = 1,1,1,-1, product = -1, result = 9 * -1 = -9
- `[0, 1]`: sum of magnitudes = 0+1 = 1, signs = 0,1, product = 0, result = 1 * 0 = 0
- `[]`: return None

```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    if not arr:
        return None
    
    # Calculate sum of magnitudes
    sum_magnitudes = sum(abs(x) for x in arr)
    
    # Calculate product of signs
    product_signs = 1
    for x in arr:
        if x > 0:
            product_signs *= 1
        elif x < 0:
            product_signs *= -1
        else:  # x == 0
            product_signs *= 0
            break  # No need to continue once we hit 0
    
    return sum_magnitudes * product_signs
```
