To solve this problem, we need to determine if two strings contain the exact same set of characters, regardless of their frequency or order. This can be efficiently achieved by converting each string into a set of characters and then comparing these sets.

Here's the reasoning:
- Convert both strings `s0` and `s1` to sets of characters.
- Compare the two sets. If they are equal, it means both strings contain the same unique characters.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str) -> bool:
    return set(s0) == set(s1)
```
