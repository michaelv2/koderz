Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Parse the string input to a number
2. Handle the rounding logic where if a number is exactly halfway between two integers, I round away from zero
3. For positive numbers: 14.5 → 15 (away from zero)
4. For negative numbers: -14.5 → -15 (away from zero)

Let me think through the approach:
- Convert string to float
- Use math.floor() and math.ceil() to get the lower and upper bounds
- Check if the number is exactly halfway
- If it's exactly halfway, round away from zero
- Otherwise, round normally

Actually, I can use Python's built-in `round()` function, but I need to be careful about the rounding behavior. Python's `round()` uses "round half to even" (banker's rounding), but the problem wants "round half away from zero".

So I'll need to implement custom logic:
- If the fractional part is < 0.5, round down
- If the fractional part is > 0.5, round up  
- If the fractional part is exactly 0.5, round away from zero

```python
def closest_integer(value):
    num = float(value)
    
    # Get the integer part and fractional part
    if num >= 0:
        # For positive numbers, if fractional part is 0.5, round up
        if num - int(num) == 0.5:
            return int(num) + 1
        else:
            return round(num)
    else:
        # For negative numbers, if fractional part is 0.5, round down (away from zero)
        if num - int(num) == -0.5:
            return int(num) - 1
        else:
            return round(num)
```
