 The problem is about finding the sorted unique common elements between two lists. To solve this, we can convert both lists to sets (which automatically removes duplicates), perform an intersection operation to find common elements, convert the result back to a list, sort it, and return the final list.

Here's the Python function that implements this solution:

```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list) -> list:
    # Convert lists to sets
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)

    # Find intersection of two sets
    common_elements = set1 & set2

    # Convert result back to a list and sort it
    sorted_common_elements = sorted(list(common_elements))

    return sorted_common_elements
```
