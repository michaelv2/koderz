To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each string in the input list, count the number of odd digits in each string, and then construct the output string with the counted number replacing all occurrences of 'i' in the template string.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the results.
2. For each string in the input list:
   - Count the number of odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
   - Construct the output string by replacing all 'i' characters with the count of odd digits.
   - Append the constructed string to the result list.
3. Return the result list.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
def odd_count(lst):
    result = []
    for s in lst:
        odd_count = sum(1 for char in s if char in '13579')
        output_string = f"the number of odd elements {odd_count}n the str{odd_count}ng {odd_count} of the {odd_count}nput."
        result.append(output_string)
    return result
```
