To solve this problem, we need to split the input string into sentences based on the delimiters '.', '?', and '!'. Then, for each sentence, we check if it starts with the word "I". If it does, we count it as a boredom. Finally, we return the total count of such sentences.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def is_bored(S):
    import re
    # Split the string into sentences using regex to match '.', '?', or '!' followed by a space or end of string
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)
    # Count sentences that start with "I"
    boredom_count = sum(1 for sentence in sentences if sentence.startswith("I"))
    return boredom_count
```
