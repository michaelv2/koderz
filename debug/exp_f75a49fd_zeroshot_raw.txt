Looking at this problem, I need to find the minimum sum of any contiguous subarray. This is the minimum subarray sum problem, which can be solved efficiently using a variation of Kadane's algorithm.

The approach is to:
1. Keep track of the minimum sum ending at the current position
2. Keep track of the overall minimum sum seen so far
3. At each position, decide whether to extend the existing subarray or start a new one

Let me trace through the examples:
- For [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]: The minimum is 1 (single element)
- For [-1, -2, -3]: The minimum is -6 (entire array)

```python
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    min_ending_here = nums[0]
    min_so_far = nums[0]
    
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        # Either extend the existing subarray or start a new one
        min_ending_here = min(nums[i], min_ending_here + nums[i])
        # Update the overall minimum
        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, min_ending_here)
    
    return min_so_far
```
