To solve the problem of finding the minimum path of length `k` in a grid, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach with backtracking. The idea is to explore all possible paths of length `k` starting from each cell and keep track of the lexicographically smallest path found.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize Variables**: We need a variable to store the minimum path found so far.
2. **DFS Function**: Define a recursive DFS function that explores all possible paths of length `k` starting from the current cell.
3. **Backtracking**: After exploring a path, backtrack to explore other possible paths.
4. **Comparison**: Compare the current path with the minimum path found so far and update if necessary.

Here's the complete implementation:

```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    
    def dfs(x, y, path):
        nonlocal min_path
        
        if len(path) == k:
            if not min_path or path < min_path:
                min_path = path[:]
            return
        
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N:
                dfs(nx, ny, path + [grid[nx][ny]])
    
    min_path = None
    
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            dfs(i, j, [grid[i][j]])
    
    return min_path
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `N` is the size of the grid.
   - `directions` contains the possible moves (up, down, left, right).

2. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function takes the current coordinates `(x, y)` and the current path as arguments.
   - If the length of the path equals `k`, we compare it with the minimum path found so far and update if necessary.
   - We explore all four possible directions from the current cell and recursively call `dfs` for each valid neighbor.

3. **Backtracking**:
   - The recursive calls handle the exploration, and backtracking happens implicitly as the function returns after exploring a path of length `k`.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - We iterate over all cells in the grid and start a DFS from each cell to find the minimum path.

This approach ensures that we explore all possible paths of length `k` and keep track of the lexicographically smallest one.
