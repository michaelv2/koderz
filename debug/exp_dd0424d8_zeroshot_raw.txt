 The problem is about validating a given date string based on certain rules. To solve this, we can split the date string into month, day, and year components. Then, we check each component against the specified conditions to determine if the date is valid.

Here's how I plan to implement the function:
1. Check if the date string is empty. If it is, return False.
2. Split the date string into month, day, and year components using '-' as the delimiter.
3. Check if there are exactly three components after splitting. If not, return False.
4. Convert each component to an integer. If any conversion fails, return False.
5. Check if the month is less than 1 or greater than 12. If it is, return False.
6. Define a dictionary with the number of days in each month (considering leap years).
7. Check if the day is less than 1 or greater than the maximum number of days for the given month. If it is, return False.
8. If all checks pass, return True.

Now, I'll write and execute the Python function to solve this problem.
```python
def valid_date(date):
    if not date:
        return False

    components = date.split('-')
    if len(components) != 3:
        return False

    try:
        month, day, year = map(int, components)
    except ValueError:
        return False

    if month < 1 or month > 12:
        return False

    days_in_month = {
        1: 31, 2: 29, 3: 31, 4: 30, 5: 31, 6: 30,
        7: 31, 8: 31, 9: 30, 10: 31, 11: 30, 12: 31
    }

    if day < 1 or day > days_in_month[month]:
        return False

    return True
```
