To solve this problem, we need to parse the input string `music_string` and convert each musical note representation into its corresponding beat value based on the provided legend:

- 'o' corresponds to 4 beats.
- 'o|' corresponds to 2 beats.
- '.|' corresponds to 1 beat.

The steps to implement this are:
1. Split the input string by spaces to get individual note representations.
2. Iterate through each note representation and map it to its corresponding beat value using a dictionary for quick lookup.
3. Collect these beat values into a list and return it.

Here's the implementation of the `parse_music` function:

```python
def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    # Define a mapping from note representations to their beat values
    note_to_beats = {
        'o': 4,
        'o|': 2,
        '.|': 1
    }
    
    # Split the input string into individual notes
    notes = music_string.split()
    
    # Convert each note to its corresponding beat value using the mapping
    beats = [note_to_beats[note] for note in notes]
    
    return beats
```

This function will correctly parse the input string and return a list of integers representing the number of beats for each note.
