Let me think through this problem:

1. I need to find the largest negative integer (closest to 0 among negatives)
2. I need to find the smallest positive integer (closest to 0 among positives)
3. If there are no negatives, return None for that position
4. If there are no positives, return None for that position
5. Zero is neither positive nor negative, so it should be ignored

My approach:
- Filter the list to get only negative integers and only positive integers
- Use `max()` on negatives to get the largest (closest to 0)
- Use `min()` on positives to get the smallest (closest to 0)
- Return None if either list is empty

```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    negatives = [x for x in lst if x < 0]
    positives = [x for x in lst if x > 0]
    
    largest_negative = max(negatives) if negatives else None
    smallest_positive = min(positives) if positives else None
    
    return (largest_negative, smallest_positive)
```
