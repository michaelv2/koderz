 The problem is about finding the maximum `k` numbers from a given array of integers and returning them in sorted order. To solve this problem, we can use Python's built-in functions to sort the array in descending order and then return the first `k` elements.

Here is the complete function implementation:

```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    return arr[:k]
```
