Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Split a string that contains words separated by commas or spaces
2. Return an array of the individual words
3. Handle cases where there might be multiple consecutive commas or spaces

The approach is to:
- Replace commas with spaces to normalize separators
- Split the string by spaces
- Filter out any empty strings that might result from the splitting

```python
def words_string(s):
    # Replace commas with spaces to normalize separators
    s = s.replace(',', ' ')
    # Split by spaces and filter out empty strings
    words = [word for word in s.split() if word]
    return words
```
