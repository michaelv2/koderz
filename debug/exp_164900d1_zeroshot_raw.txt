To solve this problem, we need to determine the intersection of two intervals and check if the length of this intersection is a prime number. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the Intersection**: 
   - Find the maximum of the start points of both intervals.
   - Find the minimum of the end points of both intervals.
   - If the maximum start point is less than or equal to the minimum end point, there is an intersection. Otherwise, there is no intersection.

2. **Calculate the Length of the Intersection**:
   - Subtract the maximum start point from the minimum end point to get the length of the intersection.

3. **Check if the Length is a Prime Number**:
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - We can create a helper function to check if a number is prime.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES".
   - Otherwise, return "NO".

Here's the complete implementation:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    start_max = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])
    end_min = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])
    
    if start_max > end_min:
        return "NO"
    
    length = end_min - start_max + 1
    
    if is_prime(length):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

This code first defines a helper function `is_prime` to check for prime numbers. Then, it calculates the intersection of the two intervals and checks if its length is a prime number, returning "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
