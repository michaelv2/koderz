To solve the problem of creating the shortest palindrome that begins with a given string, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the longest palindromic suffix of the input string.
2. Determine the prefix of the string that is not part of this palindromic suffix.
3. Reverse this prefix and append it to the end of the original string.

This approach ensures that we are adding the minimum number of characters necessary to make the entire string a palindrome.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. """
    if not string:
        return string
    
    # Function to check if a string is a palindrome
    def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
        return s == s[::-1]
    
    # Find the longest palindromic suffix
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if is_palindrome(string[i:]):
            # Append the reverse of the non-palindromic prefix to the end
            return string + string[:i][::-1]
    
    # In case no palindromic suffix is found (should not happen with above logic)
    return string + string[::-1]
```

This code defines a helper function `is_palindrome` to check if a substring is a palindrome. It then iterates over the string to find the longest palindromic suffix and constructs the shortest palindrome by appending the reverse of the non-palindromic prefix.
