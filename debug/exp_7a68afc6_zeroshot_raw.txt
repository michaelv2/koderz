Let me think through this step by step:

1. I need to delete all characters from string `s` that appear in string `c`
2. After deletion, check if the resulting string is a palindrome
3. Return a tuple with (resulting_string, is_palindrome)

For checking palindrome, I just need to verify if the string reads the same forwards and backwards.

```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    # Delete all characters in s that are in c
    result = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in c)
    
    # Check if result is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = result == result[::-1]
    
    return (result, is_palindrome)
```
