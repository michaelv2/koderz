To determine if the length of a string is a prime number, we need to:
1. Calculate the length of the string.
2. Check if this length is a prime number.

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To check for primality, we can:
- Return False if the number is less than or equal to 1.
- Check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If any number divides it evenly, it's not prime.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def prime_length(string):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        if n <= 3:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True
    
    length = len(string)
    return is_prime(length)
```
