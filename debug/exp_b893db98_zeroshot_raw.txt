To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the word from right to left and identify vowels that are surrounded by consonants. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Define a set of vowels for quick lookup.
2. Iterate through the word from the second last character to the second character (to avoid edge cases).
3. Check if the current character is a vowel and if both the characters before and after it are consonants.
4. If such a vowel is found, return it immediately.
5. If no such vowel is found by the end of the iteration, return an empty string.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def get_closest_vowel(word):
    vowels = set("aeiouAEIOU")
    
    for i in range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1):
        if word[i] in vowels and word[i-1] not in vowels and word[i+1] not in vowels:
            return word[i]
    
    return ""
```
