Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Parse a string that contains the number of apples and oranges
2. Extract the numeric values for apples and oranges
3. Subtract these from the total to get the number of mangoes

Let me analyze the pattern in the examples:
- "5 apples and 6 oranges" → apples=5, oranges=6
- "0 apples and 1 oranges" → apples=0, oranges=1
- "2 apples and 3 oranges" → apples=2, oranges=3
- "100 apples and 1 oranges" → apples=100, oranges=1

The pattern is: "{number} apples and {number} oranges"

I can use regular expressions to extract the numbers, or split the string and parse the numbers. Let me use a regex approach for robustness.

```python
import re

def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    # Extract numbers from the string using regex
    numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', s)
    apples = int(numbers[0])
    oranges = int(numbers[1])
    
    # Calculate mangoes: total - apples - oranges
    mangoes = n - apples - oranges
    
    return mangoes
```
