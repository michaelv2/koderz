To solve this problem, we need to create a new list `l'` that is identical to the original list `l` at indices that are not divisible by three. For indices that are divisible by three, we need to take the corresponding values from `l`, sort them, and place them in the same positions in `l'`.

Here's a step-by-step approach:
1. Create an empty list `l'` with the same length as `l`.
2. Iterate through the indices of `l`.
3. If the index is divisible by three, sort the corresponding value from `l` and place it in `l'`.
4. Otherwise, copy the value from `l` to `l'`.

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    l_prime = []
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            sorted_value = sorted([l[i]])[0]
            l_prime.append(sorted_value)
        else:
            l_prime.append(l[i])
    return l_prime
```
