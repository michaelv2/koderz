Let me reason through this problem:

1. I need to split the string into sentences using '.', '?', and '!' as delimiters
2. For each sentence, I need to check if it starts with the word "I"
3. Count how many sentences start with "I"
4. A sentence starts with "I" means after trimming whitespace, the first word is "I"

Here's my approach:
- Split the string by sentence delimiters while keeping track of sentences
- For each sentence, strip whitespace and check if it starts with "I " or is exactly "I"
- Count sentences that match this pattern

```python
def is_bored(S):
    import re
    # Split by sentence delimiters (. ? !)
    sentences = re.split(r'[.!?]', S)
    
    count = 0
    for sentence in sentences:
        # Strip whitespace from the sentence
        trimmed = sentence.strip()
        # Check if sentence starts with "I" as a complete word
        if trimmed.startswith("I ") or trimmed == "I":
            count += 1
    
    return count
```
