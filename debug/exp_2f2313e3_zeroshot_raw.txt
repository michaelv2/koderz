To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the list and apply specific transformations based on the index of each element:
- Square the element if its index is a multiple of 3.
- Cube the element if its index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3.
- Leave the element unchanged otherwise.

After applying these transformations, we sum up all the elements in the list and return the result.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    total = 0
    for i, x in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            total += x ** 2
        elif i % 4 == 0:
            total += x ** 3
        else:
            total += x
    return total
```
