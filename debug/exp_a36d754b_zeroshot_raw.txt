To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the given array and find the smallest even value along with its index. If there are multiple nodes with the same smallest even value, we should return the one with the smallest index. If there are no even values or the array is empty, we should return an empty list.

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement this:

1. Initialize variables to keep track of the smallest even value and its index.
2. Iterate through the array while keeping track of the current index.
3. For each element, check if it is even and smaller than the current smallest even value. If so, update the smallest even value and its index.
4. After iterating through the array, check if we found any even values.
5. If no even values were found, return an empty list.
6. Otherwise, return a list containing the smallest even value and its index.

```python
def pluck(arr):
    smallest_even = float('inf')
    smallest_index = -1
    
    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        if num % 2 == 0 and num < smallest_even:
            smallest_even = num
            smallest_index = i
    
    if smallest_index == -1:
        return []
    else:
        return [smallest_even, smallest_index]
```
