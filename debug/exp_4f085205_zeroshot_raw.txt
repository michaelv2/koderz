Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Extract the decimal part of a positive floating point number
2. The decimal part is what remains after removing the integer part
3. For 3.5, the integer part is 3, so the decimal part is 0.5

The approach is simple: subtract the integer part from the original number.

For positive numbers, `int(number)` gives the floor (largest integer smaller than the number), and `number - int(number)` gives the decimal part.

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5
    """
    return number - int(number)
```
