Looking at this problem, I need to find the largest divisor of n that is smaller than n itself.

The key insight is that the largest divisor of n (other than n) is n divided by its smallest prime factor. So instead of checking divisors from n-1 downward, I can find the smallest factor greater than 1, and return n divided by that factor.

Here's my approach:
1. Start checking from 2 upward
2. Find the first number that divides n evenly (this will be the smallest prime factor)
3. Return n divided by that smallest factor

For example, with n=15:
- 2 doesn't divide 15
- 3 divides 15, so return 15/3 = 5 ✓

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return n // i
    return 1
```

This solution has O(√n) time complexity since we only need to check up to the square root of n. If no divisor is found in that range, n is prime, so we return 1 (the only divisor smaller than n for a prime number).
