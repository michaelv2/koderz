Let me reason through this problem:

1. A string is "happy" if:
   - Its length is at least 3
   - Every 3 consecutive letters are distinct (no repeats within any window of 3 consecutive characters)

2. Algorithm:
   - First check if length >= 3
   - Then iterate through the string checking each consecutive group of 3 characters
   - For each group of 3, verify all 3 characters are different
   - If any group of 3 has duplicate characters, return False
   - If we check all groups successfully, return True

3. Examples verification:
   - "a" (len=1): False ✓
   - "aa" (len=2): False ✓
   - "abcd": Check "abc" (all distinct ✓), "bcd" (all distinct ✓) → True ✓
   - "aabb": Check "aab" (has two 'a's ✗) → False ✓
   - "adb": Check "adb" (all distinct ✓) → True ✓
   - "xyy": Check "xyy" (has two 'y's ✗) → False ✓

```python
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(s) - 2):
        # Check if 3 consecutive characters are distinct
        three_chars = s[i:i+3]
        if len(set(three_chars)) != 3:
            return False
    
    return True
```
