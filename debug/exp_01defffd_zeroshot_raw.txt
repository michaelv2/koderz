 The problem is about finding the smallest even value in an array and returning it along with its index. If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return []. To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array, keep track of the smallest even value and its index, and update them whenever we find a smaller even value.

Here's the Python function that implements this solution:

```python
def pluck(arr):
    min_even = float('inf')
    min_index = -1

    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] % 2 == 0 and arr[i] < min_even:
            min_even = arr[i]
            min_index = i

    return [min_even, min_index] if min_index != -1 else []
```
