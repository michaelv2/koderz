To solve the problem of finding sorted unique common elements between two lists, we can follow these steps:

1. Convert both lists to sets to remove duplicates and allow for efficient intersection.
2. Find the intersection of the two sets to get the common elements.
3. Convert the resulting set back to a list and sort it.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    """Return sorted unique common elements for two lists."""
    # Convert both lists to sets to remove duplicates and find intersection
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)
    
    # Convert the set back to a list and sort it
    return sorted(list(common_elements))
```
