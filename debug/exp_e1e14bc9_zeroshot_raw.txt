Problem analysis
- Core challenge: compute the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers, defined as the average of the absolute differences between each element and the dataset mean.
- Constraints: input is a list of real numbers; should handle empty input gracefully; return a float. Time complexity should be O(n) with a straightforward two-pass approach (compute mean, then sum absolute deviations).

Implementation specification
- Function signature remains def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float.
- If the input list is empty, return 0.0.
- Compute the mean of the numbers.
- Compute the sum of absolute differences from the mean, then divide by the count to obtain MAD.
- Return the resulting float.

```python
def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    if not numbers:
        return 0.0
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    return sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
```
