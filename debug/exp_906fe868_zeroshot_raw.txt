Let me reason through this problem:

1. I need to check if all keys in a dictionary are strings and either all lowercase or all uppercase
2. Return False if the dictionary is empty
3. Return False if any key is not a string
4. Return True only if all keys are strings AND all are either lowercase OR all are uppercase

Here's my approach:
- First check if dictionary is empty → return False
- Check if all keys are strings
- If all are strings, check if all are lowercase OR all are uppercase
- Handle the case where keys might not be alphabetic (e.g., "123") - these would match both lowercase and uppercase conditions since they don't change with case conversion

```python
def check_dict_case(dict):
    """
    Given a dictionary, return True if all keys are strings in lower 
    case or all keys are strings in upper case, else return False.
    The function should return False is the given dictionary is empty.
    """
    if not dict:
        return False
    
    # Check if all keys are strings
    if not all(isinstance(key, str) for key in dict.keys()):
        return False
    
    # Check if all keys are lowercase or all keys are uppercase
    keys = list(dict.keys())
    all_lower = all(key == key.lower() for key in keys)
    all_upper = all(key == key.upper() for key in keys)
    
    return all_lower or all_upper
```
