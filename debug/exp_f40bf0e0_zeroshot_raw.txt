 The problem requires us to filter out numbers from the given list that are greater than 10 and have odd first and last digits. To solve this, we can iterate through each number in the list, convert it into a string to easily access its first and last digit, check if it is greater than 10 and if both its first and last digits are odd (i.e., they are in the set {'1', '3', '5', '7', '9'}). If all conditions are met, we increment a counter that keeps track of such numbers.

Here is the Python function that implements this:

```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            str_num = str(num)
            if str_num[0] in {'1', '3', '5', '7', '9'} and str_num[-1] in {'1', '3', '5', '7', '9'}:
                count += 1
    return count
```
