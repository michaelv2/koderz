 The problem is asking to write a Python function that takes two integers as input and returns the product of their unit digits. To solve this, we can use the modulo operator (%) to extract the unit digit of each number by taking the remainder of the division by 10. Then, we multiply these unit digits together and return the result.

Here is the Python function that implements this solution:

```python
def multiply(a, b):
    # Extract the unit digit of a and b using the modulo operator
    unit_digit_a = abs(a) % 10
    unit_digit_b = abs(b) % 10

    # Multiply the unit digits together and return the result
    return unit_digit_a * unit_digit_b
```
