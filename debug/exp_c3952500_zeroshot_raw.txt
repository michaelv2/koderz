 The problem requires us to find the two closest elements from a given list of numbers. To solve this, we can sort the list and then iterate through it, comparing each pair of adjacent numbers and keeping track of the pair with the smallest difference.

Here is my plan:
1. Sort the input list in ascending order.
2. Initialize two variables to store the closest pair of elements and another variable to store the minimum difference between any two elements. Set the initial minimum difference to be infinity.
3. Iterate through the sorted list, comparing each pair of adjacent numbers. If the difference is smaller than the current minimum difference, update the closest pair and the minimum difference.
4. Return the closest pair as a tuple.

Now I will implement this plan in Python code:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    numbers.sort()
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (0, 0)
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        diff = numbers[i] - numbers[i-1]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i-1], numbers[i])
    return closest_pair
```
