I will return the k largest elements by sorting the array and taking the last k items (handling k == 0 specially), which preserves duplicates and returns them in non-decreasing order.

```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
    of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.
    """
    if k == 0:
        return []
    # Sort ascending and take the last k elements (they will be in ascending order)
    return sorted(arr)[-k:]
```
