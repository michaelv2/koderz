To solve this problem, we need to apply a linear transformation to the list of numbers such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1. This involves finding the minimum and maximum values in the list and then using these to scale each number accordingly.

The formula for rescaling a number `x` in a list is:
\[ \text{rescaled\_value} = \frac{x - \text{min}}{\text{max} - \text{min}} \]

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Find the minimum and maximum values in the list.
2. Apply the rescaling formula to each element in the list.
3. Return the new list of rescaled values.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)
    range_val = max_val - min_val
    return [(x - min_val) / range_val for x in numbers]
```

This function first calculates the minimum and maximum values of the input list. It then computes the range (difference between max and min). Finally, it applies the rescaling formula to each element in the list using a list comprehension and returns the resulting list.
