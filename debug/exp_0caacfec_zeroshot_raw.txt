To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the list of operations, updating the balance with each operation. If at any point the balance becomes negative, we should return `True`. If we finish processing all operations without the balance going below zero, we return `False`.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
