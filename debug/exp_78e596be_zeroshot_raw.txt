To solve the problem of computing the Brazilian factorial, we need to calculate the product of all factorials from `n` down to `1`. Here's a step-by-step approach to implement this:

1. **Factorial Calculation**: We need a helper function to compute the factorial of a given number.
2. **Product of Factorials**: We will use the helper function to compute the factorial for each number from `n` down to `1`, and then multiply these results together.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def factorial(num):
    """Helper function to calculate the factorial of a given number."""
    if num == 0 or num == 1:
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, num + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

def special_factorial(n):
    """Calculate the Brazilian factorial of n."""
    brazilian_fact = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        brazilian_fact *= factorial(i)
    return brazilian_fact
```

This code defines a helper function `factorial` to compute the factorial of a single number and then uses it within the `special_factorial` function to calculate the product of all factorials from `n` down to `1`.
