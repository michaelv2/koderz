To solve this problem, we need to use Python's `hashlib` library, which provides a common interface to many secure hash and message digest algorithms, including MD5. The function will take a string as input, compute its MD5 hash, and return the hexadecimal representation of the hash. If the input string is empty, the function should return `None`.

Here's the implementation:

```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text):
    if text == '':
        return None
    md5_hash = hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
    return md5_hash
```
