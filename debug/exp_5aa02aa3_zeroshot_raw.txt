 The problem is about parsing a string of nested parentheses and determining the maximum depth of nesting for each group. To solve this, we can iterate through each character in the input string and use a stack to keep track of the opening parentheses. When we encounter a closing parenthesis, we pop from the stack and increment a counter that keeps track of the current depth. We update the maximum depth for the current group whenever we reach a new maximum.

Here's the Python function implementation:

```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    stack = []
    max_depths = []
    current_max = 0

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
            current_max = max(current_max, len(stack))
        elif char == ')':
            stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                max_depths.append(current_max)
                current_max = 0
    return max_depths
```
