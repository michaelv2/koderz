Looking at this problem, I need to create a function that calculates the area of a triangle given the length of a side and the corresponding height.

The formula for the area of a triangle is:
Area = (1/2) × base × height

Where:
- `a` represents the length of a side (base)
- `h` represents the height perpendicular to that side

Given the example:
- triangle_area(5, 3) should return 7.5
- Using the formula: (1/2) × 5 × 3 = 7.5 ✓

```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    return 0.5 * a * h
```
