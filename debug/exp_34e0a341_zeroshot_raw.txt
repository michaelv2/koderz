I will replace commas with spaces and then split on whitespace to get the words.

```python
def words_string(s):
    """
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    """
    if s is None:
        return []
    return s.replace(",", " ").split()
```
