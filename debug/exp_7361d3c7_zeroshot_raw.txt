To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the list and keep track of the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer. We can initialize two variables as `None` to represent these values initially. As we iterate through the list, we update these variables whenever we find a larger negative integer or a smaller positive integer.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    largest_negative = None
    smallest_positive = None
    
    for num in lst:
        if num < 0:
            if largest_negative is None or num > largest_negative:
                largest_negative = num
        elif num > 0:
            if smallest_positive is None or num < smallest_positive:
                smallest_positive = num
                
    return (largest_negative, smallest_positive)
```
