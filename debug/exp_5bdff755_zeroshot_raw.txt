 I will create a Python function that follows these steps:

1. Filter the array to only include numbers between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
2. Sort this filtered list in ascending order.
3. Reverse the sorted list.
4. Map each number in the reversed list to its corresponding name from "One", "Two", ..., "Nine".
5. Return the resulting list of names.

Here is the Python function that implements these steps:

```python
def by_length(arr):
    # Define a dictionary mapping numbers to their names
    num_to_name = {1: 'One', 2: 'Two', 3: 'Three', 4: 'Four', 5: 'Five', 6: 'Six', 7: 'Seven', 8: 'Eight', 9: 'Nine'}
    # Filter the array to only include numbers between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
    filtered_arr = [num for num in arr if 1 <= num <= 9]
    # Sort this filtered list in ascending order
    sorted_arr = sorted(filtered_arr)
    # Reverse the sorted list
    reversed_arr = sorted_arr[::-1]
    # Map each number in the reversed list to its corresponding name from "One", "Two", ..., "Nine"
    result = [num_to_name[num] for num in reversed_arr]
    return result
```
