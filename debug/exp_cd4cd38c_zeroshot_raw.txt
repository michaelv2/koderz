Let me think through this problem:

1. We need to find the minimum sum of any contiguous sub-array
2. This is a variant of the classic maximum subarray problem (Kadane's algorithm), but looking for minimum instead
3. We can use a modified Kadane's algorithm where we track the minimum sum ending at each position
4. At each element, we decide whether to extend the previous sub-array or start a new one with just the current element

The approach:
- Keep track of the minimum sum seen so far globally
- Keep track of the minimum sum ending at the current position
- For each element, the minimum sum ending at current position is the minimum of:
  - The current element alone
  - The current element plus the minimum sum ending at the previous position
- Update the global minimum as we go

```python
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    """
    Given an array of integers nums, find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array
    of nums.
    """
    min_ending_here = nums[0]
    min_so_far = nums[0]
    
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        min_ending_here = min(nums[i], min_ending_here + nums[i])
        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, min_ending_here)
    
    return min_so_far
```
