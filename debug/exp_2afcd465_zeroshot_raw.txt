```python
def even_odd_count(num):
    # Convert the number to positive if it's negative
    num = abs(num)
    
    # Initialize counters for even and odd digits
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each digit in the number
    while num > 0:
        digit = num % 10
        
        # If the digit is even, increment the even counter
        if digit % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
            
        # Remove the last digit from the number
        num //= 10
    
    return (even_count, odd_count)
```
This function works by iterating over each digit in the given number. It checks if the current digit is even or odd and increments the respective counter. After that, it removes the last digit from the number until there are no more digits left to check. Finally, it returns a tuple with the count of even and odd digits.
