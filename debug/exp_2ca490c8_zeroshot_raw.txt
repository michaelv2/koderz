To solve this problem, we need to check two conditions for the list `q`:
1. The list should be palindromic, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards.
2. The sum of the elements in the list should be less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`.

Here's how we can implement this:

- Check if the list is equal to its reverse to determine if it's palindromic.
- Calculate the sum of the list and compare it with `w`.

If both conditions are satisfied, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w
```
