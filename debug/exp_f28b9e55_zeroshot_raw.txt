To solve the problem of finding the maximum element in a list, we can utilize Python's built-in `max()` function, which is designed to return the largest item in an iterable. This approach is efficient and leverages Python's standard library capabilities.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. We need to define a function named `max_element` that takes a single parameter `l`, which is expected to be a list.
2. Inside the function, we will use the `max()` function to find and return the maximum element in the list `l`.
3. The `max()` function handles the comparison of elements internally and returns the largest one.

Given this reasoning, here's the implementation:

```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list."""
    return max(l)
```
