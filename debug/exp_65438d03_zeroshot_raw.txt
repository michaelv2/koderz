To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the digits of the given integer `N`.
2. Convert the sum into its binary representation.
3. Return the binary string.

Here's the Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def solve(N):
    # Calculate the sum of the digits of N
    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(N))
    
    # Convert the sum to a binary string and return it
    return bin(digit_sum)[2:]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sum of Digits**: We convert the integer `N` to a string to iterate over each digit, convert each digit back to an integer, and then sum them up.
2. **Binary Conversion**: We use Python's built-in `bin()` function to convert the sum to a binary string. The `bin()` function returns a string prefixed with '0b', so we slice off the first two characters using `[2:]` to get the pure binary representation.

This function will correctly compute and return the binary string of the sum of the digits for any valid input within the given constraints.
