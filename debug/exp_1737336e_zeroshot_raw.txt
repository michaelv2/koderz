To solve this problem, we need to generate an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a[i]` is calculated as `i * i - i + 1`. Then, we need to find the number of triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` such that `i < j < k` and the sum `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is divisible by 3.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Generate the array `a` using the given formula.
2. Iterate through all possible triples `(i, j, k)` with `i < j < k`.
3. Check if the sum of the triple is divisible by 3.
4. Count and return the number of such valid triples.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    a = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            for k in range(j + 1, n):
                if (a[i] + a[j] + a[k]) % 3 == 0:
                    count += 1
    return count
```

This function first constructs the array `a` and then uses three nested loops to check all possible triples `(i, j, k)` with `i < j < k`. It increments the count whenever the sum of the triple is divisible by 3. Finally, it returns the count.
