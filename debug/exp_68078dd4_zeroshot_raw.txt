Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Check if concatenating two strings in either order results in a balanced parentheses string
2. A balanced string has equal '(' and ')', and at no point while reading left-to-right should ')' count exceed '(' count

Let me think through the approach:
- I have two strings from a list
- I can concatenate them as `str1 + str2` or `str2 + str1`
- For each concatenation, I need to check if it's "good" (balanced)
- To check if a string is balanced:
  - Count balance as we go left to right
  - Increment for '(', decrement for ')'
  - If balance ever goes negative, it's invalid
  - If balance is 0 at the end, it's valid

Let me trace through the examples:
- `['()(', ')']`: 
  - Try `'()(' + ')'` = `'()()'` → balance: 1,0,1,0 → valid ✓
  - Return 'Yes'
- `[')', ')']`:
  - Try `')' + ')'` = `'))'` → balance goes negative immediately → invalid
  - Try `')' + ')'` = `'))'` → same → invalid
  - Return 'No'

```python
def match_parens(lst):
    def is_balanced(s):
        balance = 0
        for char in s:
            if char == '(':
                balance += 1
            else:  # char == ')'
                balance -= 1
            if balance < 0:
                return False
        return balance == 0
    
    # Try both concatenation orders
    if is_balanced(lst[0] + lst[1]) or is_balanced(lst[1] + lst[0]):
        return 'Yes'
    else:
        return 'No'
```
