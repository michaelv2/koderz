To solve this problem, we need to extract the number of apples and oranges from the given string and then subtract these numbers from the total number of fruits to find the number of mangoes.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Parse the input string to extract the number of apples and oranges.
2. Convert these extracted numbers from strings to integers.
3. Subtract the sum of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes.
4. Return the result.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    # Split the string into words
    parts = s.split()
    
    # Extract the number of apples and oranges
    num_apples = int(parts[0])
    num_oranges = int(parts[3])
    
    # Calculate the number of mangoes
    num_mangoes = n - num_apples - num_oranges
    
    return num_mangoes
```

This function will correctly parse the input string, compute the number of mangoes, and return the result.
