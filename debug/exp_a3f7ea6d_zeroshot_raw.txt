 The problem is about filtering out positive integers from a list that do not contain any even digits and returning the sorted list of these elements. To solve this problem, we can iterate through each number in the input list, convert it to a string, check if any digit is even, and if not, add it to our result list. Finally, we sort and return the result list.

Here's the Python function that implements this solution:

```python
def unique_digits(x):
    result = []
    for num in x:
        if all(int(digit) % 2 != 0 for digit in str(num)):
            result.append(num)
    return sorted(result)
```
