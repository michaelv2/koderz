 The problem is about rescaling a list of numbers such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1. This can be achieved by subtracting the minimum value from each number and then dividing the result by the range (maximum - minimum) of the original list.

Here's how I plan to solve this problem:

1. Find the minimum and maximum values in the given list of numbers.
2. Subtract the minimum value from each number in the list. This will shift all the numbers such that the smallest number becomes 0.
3. Calculate the range of the new list (maximum - minimum).
4. Divide each number in the list by the range. This will ensure that the largest number becomes 1.

Now, I'll write and execute the Python function to solve this problem.
```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)
    range_val = max_val - min_val
    return [(i - min_val) / range_val for i in numbers]
```
