 The problem is about converting a given decimal number into binary format and returning it as a string with 'db' at the beginning and end of the string. To solve this problem, we can use Python's built-in bin() function to convert the decimal number to binary, remove the '0b' prefix that the bin() function adds by default, and then add 'db' at both ends of the resulting binary string.

Here is the complete solution in a Python code block:

```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    # Convert decimal to binary using bin() function and remove '0b' prefix
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]
    # Add 'db' at both ends of the binary string and return it
    return "db" + binary + "db"
```
