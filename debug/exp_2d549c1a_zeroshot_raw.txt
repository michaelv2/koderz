Let me reason through this problem:

1. I need to identify words in the sentence (separated by spaces)
2. For each word, I need to check if its length is a prime number
3. Return only the words with prime lengths, maintaining their original order

Key steps:
- Split the sentence by spaces to get individual words
- Create a helper function to check if a number is prime
- Filter words where the length is prime
- Join them back with spaces

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For length checking:
- Length 1: not prime
- Length 2: prime (only divisors: 1, 2)
- Length 3: prime (only divisors: 1, 3)
- Length 4: not prime (divisors: 1, 2, 4)
- Length 5: prime (only divisors: 1, 5)
- And so on...

```python
def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n < 2:
            return False
        if n == 2:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return False
        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    words = sentence.split()
    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return " ".join(prime_length_words)
```
