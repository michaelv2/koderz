To solve this problem, we need to focus on sorting the elements at even indices while keeping the elements at odd indices unchanged. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Extract the elements at even indices from the list.
2. Sort these extracted elements.
3. Reconstruct the original list by placing the sorted even-indexed elements back into their respective positions, while leaving the odd-indexed elements unchanged.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    # Extract elements at even indices
    even_index_elements = [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 2)]
    
    # Sort the extracted elements
    even_index_elements.sort()
    
    # Create a new list to store the result
    result = l[:]
    
    # Place sorted even-indexed elements back into their positions
    even_index = 0
    for i in range(0, len(l), 2):
        result[i] = even_index_elements[even_index]
        even_index += 1
    
    return result
```

This function will correctly sort the elements at even indices while keeping the odd-indexed elements unchanged.
