Looking at this problem, I need to create a function that inserts a delimiter between every two consecutive elements of a list.

Let me trace through the examples:
- `intersperse([], 4)` should return `[]` (empty list stays empty)
- `intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)` should return `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]` (delimiter 4 inserted between each pair)

My approach:
1. Handle the edge case of empty list
2. For non-empty lists, iterate through the elements and insert the delimiter between them
3. I can build the result by:
   - Taking the first element
   - Then for each subsequent element, adding the delimiter followed by the element

```python
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'
    >>> intersperse([], 4)
    []
    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
    """
    if not numbers:
        return []
    
    result = [numbers[0]]
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        result.append(delimeter)
        result.append(numbers[i])
    
    return result
```
