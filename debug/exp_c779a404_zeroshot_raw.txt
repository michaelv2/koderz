 The problem is about performing a circular shift on the digits of an integer. If the shift value is less than or equal to the number of digits, we should move each digit right by that amount. If the shift value is greater than the number of digits, we should reverse the order of the digits.

Here's how I plan to solve this problem:
1. Convert the integer into a string to easily manipulate its digits.
2. Check if the shift value is less than or equal to the length of the string. If it is, perform a circular right shift by slicing the string and concatenating the two parts in reverse order.
3. If the shift value is greater than the length of the string, reverse the entire string.
4. Return the resulting string.

Now, let's implement this solution in Python:

```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    x = str(x)
    if shift <= len(x):
        return x[-shift:] + x[:-shift]
    else:
        return x[::-1]
```
