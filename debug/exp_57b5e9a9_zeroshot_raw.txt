 I'll define a Python function called `special_factorial` that calculates the Brazilian factorial as described in the problem statement. The function will take an integer `n` as input and return the special factorial of this integer.

The calculation of the special factorial involves multiplying the factorials of all numbers from `n` down to 1. To calculate a single factorial, I'll use a loop that multiplies all integers from the given number down to 1. This will be done inside another loop that iterates over the range from `n` down to 1.

Here is my solution:

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        factorial = 1
        for j in range(i, 0, -1):
            factorial *= j
        result *= factorial
    return result
```
