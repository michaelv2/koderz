To solve the problem of finding the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime, we need to generate Fibonacci numbers and check each one for primality until we find the required count of such numbers.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Generate Fibonacci Numbers**: We will use a generator function to yield Fibonacci numbers indefinitely.
2. **Check for Primality**: For each Fibonacci number generated, we will check if it is prime.
3. **Count Prime Fibonacci Numbers**: We will keep a count of how many prime Fibonacci numbers have been found and stop once we reach the n-th one.

### Key Points:
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
- **Prime Check**: A number is prime if it is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself. We can optimize this check by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number.

### Implementation:
- Use a generator for Fibonacci numbers to avoid storing all Fibonacci numbers in memory.
- Implement an efficient primality test function.
- Iterate through the Fibonacci sequence, checking each number for primality, and count until we reach the n-th prime Fibonacci number.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def fibonacci():
    """Generate Fibonacci numbers indefinitely."""
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

def prime_fib(n: int):
    """Return the n-th number that is both a Fibonacci number and prime."""
    fib_gen = fibonacci()
    count = 0
    while True:
        fib_num = next(fib_gen)
        if is_prime(fib_num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return fib_num
```

This code defines the necessary functions to generate Fibonacci numbers, check for primality, and find the n-th prime Fibonacci number.
