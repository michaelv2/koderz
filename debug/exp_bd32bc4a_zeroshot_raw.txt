I'll count elements that are strictly greater than 10 and whose first and last decimal digits are both odd.

```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    """Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns 
    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    """
    count = 0
    for n in nums:
        if not isinstance(n, int):
            # skip non-integers (or treat by integer part)
            try:
                n = int(n)
            except Exception:
                continue
        if n > 10:
            s = str(n)
            if int(s[0]) % 2 == 1 and int(s[-1]) % 2 == 1:
                count += 1
    return count
