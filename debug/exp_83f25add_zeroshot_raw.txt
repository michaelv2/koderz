 The problem is asking to find the largest index of an element in the array that is not greater than or equal to its preceding element. If no such element exists, return -1. To solve this, we can iterate through the array from right to left and check if each element is less than its next one. If we find such an element, we return its index; otherwise, we return -1.

Here's the Python function that implements this logic:

```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 2, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i + 1]:
            return i
    return -1
```
