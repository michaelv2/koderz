Let me reason through this problem:

1. If the string contains letters, I need to:
   - Swap the case of each letter (lower→upper, upper→lower)
   - Keep non-letter characters as they are

2. If the string contains no letters at all, I need to:
   - Reverse the entire string

3. I can check if a character is a letter using `isalpha()`
4. I can swap case using `swapcase()` method or manually with `isupper()`/`islower()`

Here's my approach:
- First, check if the string contains any letters
- If it has letters: swap case of each character (letters swap, non-letters stay same)
- If it has no letters: reverse the string

```python
def solve(s):
    # Check if string contains any letters
    has_letters = any(c.isalpha() for c in s)
    
    if has_letters:
        # Swap case of letters, keep non-letters as is
        return ''.join(c.swapcase() if c.isalpha() else c for c in s)
    else:
        # No letters found, reverse the string
        return s[::-1]
```
