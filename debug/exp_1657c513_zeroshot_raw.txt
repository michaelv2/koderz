```python
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        result.append(numbers[i])
        if i < len(numbers) - 1:
            result.append(delimeter)
    return result
```

This function works by iterating over the input list and appending each element to a new list, followed by the delimiter (if it's not the last element). This results in every two consecutive elements being separated by the delimiter.
