Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Take an integer as input
2. Count how many even digits and odd digits it contains
3. Return a tuple with (even_count, odd_count)

Let me trace through the examples:
- For -12: digits are 1 and 2. 1 is odd, 2 is even. So (1, 1)
- For 123: digits are 1, 2, 3. 1 is odd, 2 is even, 3 is odd. So (1, 2)

I need to:
1. Handle the negative sign by taking absolute value
2. Extract each digit
3. Check if each digit is even or odd
4. Count them accordingly

```python
def even_odd_count(num):
    """Given an integer. return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.

     Example:
        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)
        even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)
    """
    num = abs(num)
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Handle the special case of 0
    if num == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    
    while num > 0:
        digit = num % 10
        if digit % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
        num //= 10
    
    return (even_count, odd_count)
```
