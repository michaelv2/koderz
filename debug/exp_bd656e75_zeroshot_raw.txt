Looking at this problem, I need to find the largest index where an element is less than the element immediately preceding it.

Let me trace through the examples:
- `can_arrange([1,2,4,3,5])`: 
  - Index 1: 2 >= 1 ✓
  - Index 2: 4 >= 2 ✓  
  - Index 3: 3 < 4 ✗ (this is where the condition fails)
  - Index 4: 5 >= 3 ✓
  - The largest index where element < preceding element is 3

- `can_arrange([1,2,3])`:
  - Index 1: 2 >= 1 ✓
  - Index 2: 3 >= 2 ✓
  - No element is less than its predecessor, so return -1

My approach:
1. Iterate through the array starting from index 1 (since we need to compare with previous element)
2. For each element, check if it's less than the previous element
3. Keep track of the largest index where this condition is met
4. Return that index, or -1 if no such index exists

```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    largest_index = -1
    
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] < arr[i-1]:
            largest_index = i
    
    return largest_index
```
