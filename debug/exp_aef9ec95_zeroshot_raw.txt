To solve this problem, we need to determine if there are any two numbers in a given list that are closer to each other than a specified threshold.

### Approach
The approach involves the following steps:
1. **Sort the List**: Sorting helps in efficiently checking adjacent elements for closeness since the closest elements will be next to each other after sorting.
2. **Check Adjacent Elements**: After sorting, iterate through the list and compare each element with its next neighbor. If any pair has a difference less than the threshold, return `True`.
3. **Return Result**: If no such pair is found after checking all adjacent elements, return `False`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check for closeness by leveraging sorting, which simplifies the comparison process.

### Solution Code
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    numbers_sorted = sorted(numbers)
    for i in range(len(numbers_sorted) - 1):
        if abs(numbers_sorted[i] - numbers_sorted[i+1]) < threshold:
            return True
    return False
```

### Explanation
- **Sorting**: The list is sorted to bring the closest elements next to each other, which simplifies checking.
- **Iteration and Comparison**: By iterating through the sorted list and comparing each element with its neighbor, we can efficiently determine if any two elements are closer than the threshold.
- **Efficiency**: Sorting takes O(n log n) time, and the subsequent iteration is O(n), making the overall approach efficient for this problem.
