 The problem is about inserting a given delimiter between every two consecutive elements of a list. To solve this, we can iterate through the input list and for each element, append it to the result list followed by the delimiter (except for the last element).

Here's the Python function that implements this:

```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        result.append(num)
        if num != numbers[-1]:  # Check if it's not the last element
            result.append(delimeter)
    return result
```
