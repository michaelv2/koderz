To solve the problem of performing a binary XOR operation on two strings consisting only of 1s and 0s, we can follow these steps:

1. Ensure both input strings are of the same length since XOR is performed bit by bit.
2. Iterate through each character in the strings, convert them to integers, perform the XOR operation, and then convert the result back to a string.
3. Concatenate the results of each XOR operation to form the final result string.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """ Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.
    """
    if len(a) != len(b):
        raise ValueError("Input strings must be of the same length")
    
    result = []
    for char_a, char_b in zip(a, b):
        # Convert characters to integers, perform XOR, and convert back to string
        xor_result = str(int(char_a) ^ int(char_b))
        result.append(xor_result)
    
    return ''.join(result)
```

This function first checks if the input strings are of the same length. If not, it raises a `ValueError`. Then, it iterates through each pair of characters from the two strings, performs the XOR operation, and constructs the resulting string by joining all individual results.
