 The problem requires us to count the number of sentences that start with "I" in a given string. To solve this, we can split the string into sentences using punctuation marks as delimiters and then check each sentence to see if it starts with "I".

Here's my plan:
1. Split the input string into sentences using regular expressions (re module) to handle multiple punctuation marks.
2. Initialize a counter for boredoms.
3. Iterate over each sentence, strip leading and trailing spaces, and check if it starts with "I". If so, increment the counter.
4. Return the final count of boredoms.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
import re

def is_bored(S):
    sentences = re.split('[.?!]', S)
    boredoms = 0
    for sentence in sentences:
        if sentence.strip().startswith("I"):
            boredoms += 1
    return boredoms
```
