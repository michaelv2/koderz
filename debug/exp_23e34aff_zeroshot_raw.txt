To solve this problem, we need to create a list of size `n` where each element at index `i` (starting from 1) follows these rules:
- If `i` is even, the element should be the factorial of `i`.
- If `i` is odd, the element should be the sum of numbers from 1 to `i`.

We will use Python's built-in functions and loops to achieve this. Specifically, we can use a loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to `n`, calculate the required value based on whether the index is even or odd, and append it to the result list.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def f(n):
    def factorial(x):
        if x == 0 or x == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            return x * factorial(x - 1)
    
    def sum_to(x):
        return x * (x + 1) // 2
    
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(factorial(i))
        else:
            result.append(sum_to(i))
    
    return result
```
