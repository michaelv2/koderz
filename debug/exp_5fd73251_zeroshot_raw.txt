To solve this problem, we need to extract the `k` largest elements from the given array and return them in sorted order. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Extract the k Largest Elements**: We can use Python's `heapq.nlargest` function which efficiently finds the `k` largest elements in an array.
2. **Sort the Extracted Elements**: Once we have the `k` largest elements, we sort them to meet the requirement of returning a sorted list.

Here is the implementation:

```python
import heapq

def maximum(arr, k):
    # Use heapq.nlargest to get the k largest elements
    largest_k = heapq.nlargest(k, arr)
    # Sort the k largest elements before returning
    return sorted(largest_k)
```

This code uses the `heapq` module to efficiently find the `k` largest elements and then sorts them to ensure the output is in ascending order.
