 The problem can be solved by iterating through the string and keeping track of the number of open brackets. If we encounter a closing bracket and there are open brackets before it, then we have found a nested subsequence.

Here is the Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def is_nested(string):
    open_brackets = 0
    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            open_brackets += 1
        elif char == ']' and open_brackets > 0:
            open_brackets -= 1
            return True
    return False
```

This function works by iterating through each character in the string. If it encounters an opening bracket, it increments a counter. If it encounters a closing bracket and there are any open brackets left (i.e., the counter is greater than 0), it decrements the counter and immediately returns True, since we have found a nested subsequence. If it finishes iterating through the string without finding a nested subsequence, it returns False.
