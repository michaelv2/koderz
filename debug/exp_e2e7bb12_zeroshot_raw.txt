 The problem is about determining whether at any point the balance of a bank account falls below zero given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations. To solve this, we can iterate through the list of operations, updating the balance after each operation and checking if it becomes negative. If it does, we return True; otherwise, we return False after checking all operations.

Here's my plan:
1. Initialize a variable `balance` to 0 to keep track of the account balance.
2. Iterate through each operation in the list.
3. After each operation, update the balance by adding the current operation value to it.
4. Check if the updated balance is less than zero. If it is, return True immediately.
5. If we've checked all operations and the balance has not fallen below zero, return False.

Now I'll write the Python function implementing this plan.
```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
