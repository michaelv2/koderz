The solution filters out strings with odd lengths and returns the remaining strings sorted first by length and then alphabetically.

```python
def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    """Remove strings with odd lengths and return the list sorted by length then alphabetically."""
    even_words = [s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 == 0]
    return sorted(even_words, key=lambda s: (len(s), s))
```
