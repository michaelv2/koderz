To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the list of words and determine which word has the maximum number of unique characters. If there is a tie, we should return the word that comes first lexicographically.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize variables to keep track of the word with the maximum number of unique characters and the count of those characters.
2. Iterate through each word in the list.
3. For each word, calculate the number of unique characters using a set.
4. Compare this count with the current maximum. If it's greater, update the maximum and the corresponding word.
5. If the count is equal to the current maximum, compare the words lexicographically and update if the new word comes first.
6. Return the word with the maximum number of unique characters.

```python
def find_max(words):
    max_unique_count = 0
    result_word = ""
    
    for word in words:
        unique_chars = set(word)
        unique_count = len(unique_chars)
        
        if unique_count > max_unique_count or (unique_count == max_unique_count and word < result_word):
            max_unique_count = unique_count
            result_word = word
    
    return result_word
```
