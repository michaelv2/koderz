 The problem requires sorting an array of non-negative integers based on the sum of the first and last elements being odd or even. If it's odd, we sort the array in ascending order; otherwise, we sort it in descending order. To solve this, I will:

1. Create a copy of the given array to avoid modifying the original one.
2. Check if the sum of the first and last elements is odd or even.
3. Sort the copied array based on the condition.
4. Return the sorted array.

Here's my solution:

```python
def sort_array(array):
    # Create a copy of the given array
    arr = array[:]

    # Check if the sum of the first and last elements is odd or even
    if (arr[0] + arr[-1]) % 2 == 0:
        # Sort in descending order if the sum is even
        arr.sort(reverse=True)
    else:
        # Sort in ascending order if the sum is odd
        arr.sort()

    return arr
```
