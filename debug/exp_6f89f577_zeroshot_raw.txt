To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the given integer `N` to its binary representation.
2. Calculate the sum of the digits in this binary representation.
3. Convert this sum back to a binary string and return it.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def solve(N):
    # Convert N to binary, remove the '0b' prefix, and sum the digits
    binary_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in bin(N)[2:])
    # Convert the sum to a binary string and return it
    return bin(binary_sum)[2:]
```
