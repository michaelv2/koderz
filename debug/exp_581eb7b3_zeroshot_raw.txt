To solve this problem, we need to sort the elements of the list that are located at indices divisible by three while keeping all other elements in their original positions.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Identify the indices in the list that are divisible by three.
2. Extract the elements at these indices.
3. Sort the extracted elements.
4. Place the sorted elements back into their original positions in a new list, leaving all other elements unchanged.

Let's implement this logic in the `sort_third` function:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    # Step 1: Identify indices divisible by three
    indices_div_by_three = [i for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0]
    
    # Step 2: Extract elements at these indices
    elements_to_sort = [l[i] for i in indices_div_by_three]
    
    # Step 3: Sort the extracted elements
    sorted_elements = sorted(elements_to_sort)
    
    # Step 4: Create a new list and place sorted elements back at their respective positions
    result = l[:]
    for idx, sorted_value in zip(indices_div_by_three, sorted_elements):
        result[idx] = sorted_value
    
    return result
```

This function will correctly sort the elements at indices divisible by three while keeping other elements unchanged.
