To solve this problem, we need to sort the list of integers based on the sum of their digits while maintaining the original order for numbers with the same digit sum.

Here's a step-by-step approach:
1. Define a helper function to calculate the sum of digits of an integer.
2. Use Python's built-in `sorted` function with a custom key that first considers the sum of digits and then the index of the element in the original list.

```python
def order_by_points(nums):
    def digit_sum(n):
        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(n)))
    
    return sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (digit_sum(x), nums.index(x)))
```

This code block defines the `order_by_points` function which sorts the list of integers based on the sum of their digits and maintains the original order for numbers with the same digit sum.
