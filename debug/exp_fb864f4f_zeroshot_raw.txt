 The problem is about finding all the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer n. To solve this, we can create a function that generates the Collatz sequence for a number and filters out the even numbers to return only the odd ones.

Here's how I plan to implement the solution:
1. Define a helper function `collatz_sequence` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns its Collatz sequence.
2. In the main function `get_odd_collatz`, use a while loop to generate the Collatz sequence for `n`.
3. Filter out the even numbers from the sequence using list comprehension.
4. Sort the resulting list in increasing order and return it.

Now, let's write the code:

```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    def collatz_sequence(num):
        seq = [num]
        while num != 1:
            if num % 2 == 0:
                num //= 2
            else:
                num = 3 * num + 1
            seq.append(num)
        return seq

    collatz_seq = collatz_sequence(n)
    odd_collatz_seq = sorted([num for num in collatz_seq if num % 2 != 0])
    return odd_collatz_seq
```
