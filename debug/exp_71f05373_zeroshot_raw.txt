 The problem is about finding the prime factors of a given integer and returning them in a list from smallest to largest. To solve this problem, we can start by dividing the number by 2 until it's no longer divisible, then check for other odd factors up to the square root of the number.

Here's my plan:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the prime factors.
2. While the number is divisible by 2, divide it by 2 and add 2 to the list of factors.
3. Start checking for odd factors from 3 up to the square root of the number. For each potential factor, while the number is divisible by that factor, divide it by the factor and add the factor to the list.
4. If the remaining number is greater than 2, it's a prime number, so add it to the list of factors.
5. Return the list of factors.

Now I'll write the Python function to solve this problem.
```python
from typing import List
import math

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):
        while n % i== 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
