```python
def fib(n):
    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
    a, b = 0, 1
    
    # Calculate the n-th Fibonacci number iteratively
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
        
    return a
```
This function uses an iterative approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It initializes two variables `a` and `b` to 0 and 1, which are the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. Then it enters a loop that runs `n` times. In each iteration of the loop, it updates `a` and `b` to `b` and `a + b` respectively. After the loop finishes, `a` will be the n-th Fibonacci number.
