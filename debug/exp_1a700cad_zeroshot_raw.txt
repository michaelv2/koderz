To solve this problem, we need to extract the decimal part of a given positive floating point number. The decimal part is what remains after removing the integer part from the original number.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Use the `math.floor()` function to get the largest integer smaller than or equal to the given number.
2. Subtract this integer part from the original number to get the decimal part.

Let's implement this in the `truncate_number` function:

```python
import math

def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    an integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    """
    integer_part = math.floor(number)
    decimal_part = number - integer_part
    return decimal_part
```

This function will correctly return the decimal part of any positive floating point number provided as input.
