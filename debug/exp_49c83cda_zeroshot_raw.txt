Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Find the largest even integer in the range [x, y] inclusive
2. If no such number exists, return -1
3. Handle the case where x > y (invalid range)

Let me think through the approach:
- If x > y, return -1 immediately
- Start from y (the upper bound) and work backwards to find the largest even number
- If y is even, that's our answer
- If y is odd, then y-1 is even (if y-1 >= x), otherwise we continue checking
- We can also use a more mathematical approach: find the largest even number <= y, then check if it's >= x

Actually, let me think more carefully:
- If x > y, return -1
- The largest even number in [x, y] would be:
  - If y is even, return y
  - If y is odd, return y-1 (if y-1 >= x), otherwise return -1

Let me trace through the examples:
- choose_num(12, 15): y=15 (odd), so check if 14 >= 12. Yes, return 14
- choose_num(13, 12): x > y, so return -1

```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If 
    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.

    For example:
    choose_num(12, 15) = 14
    choose_num(13, 12) = -1
    """
    if x > y:
        return -1
    
    # Start from y and go backwards to find the largest even number
    if y % 2 == 0:
        # y is even, so it's our answer
        return y
    else:
        # y is odd, so check if y-1 is within range
        if y - 1 >= x:
            return y - 1
        else:
            return -1
```
