To solve the problem of finding three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero, we can use a nested loop approach. The outer loop will iterate through each element, and the inner loops will check for pairs that, when added to the current element, sum to zero.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    n = len(l)
    for i in range(n):
        seen = set()
        target = -l[i]
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if target - l[j] in seen:
                return True
            seen.add(l[j])
    return False
```

### Explanation:
1. **Outer Loop**: Iterate through each element `l[i]` in the list.
2. **Target Calculation**: For each element `l[i]`, calculate the target value that, when added to `l[i]`, should sum to zero. This is `-l[i]`.
3. **Inner Loop and Set**: Use a set `seen` to keep track of elements encountered so far in the inner loop.
4. **Check for Complement**: For each element `l[j]` in the inner loop (starting from `i + 1`), check if `target - l[j]` exists in the `seen` set. If it does, return `True` because we have found three elements that sum to zero.
5. **Add Element to Set**: If no complement is found, add `l[j]` to the `seen` set and continue.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check for triples that sum to zero without using brute-force triple nested loops, which would be less efficient.
