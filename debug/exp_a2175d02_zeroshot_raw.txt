To solve the problem of finding the n-th Fibonacci number, we can use an iterative approach to avoid the inefficiencies of recursion. The iterative method will compute the Fibonacci sequence up to the n-th number using a loop, which is both time and space efficient.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b
```
