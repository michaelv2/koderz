The problem is asking to find two numbers from the list that are closest to each other. This can be solved by sorting the list and comparing adjacent elements. The reason for this approach is because after sorting, if there are two identical smallest differences between any two successive elements, they will be next to each other in the sorted list.

Here's a Python function that implements this:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    numbers.sort()  # Sort the list in ascending order
    min_diff = float('inf')  # Initialize minimum difference as infinity
    closest_pair = (None, None)  # Initialize closest pair as none
    
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        diff = numbers[i] - numbers[i-1]  # Calculate the difference with previous number
        
        if diff < min_diff:  # If this difference is less than current minimum difference
            min_diff = diff  # Update the minimum difference
            closest_pair = (numbers[i-1], numbers[i])  # And update the closest pair
            
    return closest_pair
```
This function works by first sorting the list of numbers. Then it iterates over each number in the sorted list, calculating the difference with its predecessor. If this difference is less than the current minimum difference, it updates the minimum difference and stores the pair of numbers as the new closest pair. Finally, it returns the closest pair.
