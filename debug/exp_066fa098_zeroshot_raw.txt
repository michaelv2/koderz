Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Count the number of distinct characters in a string
2. Case-insensitive comparison (so 'x' and 'X' are considered the same character)
3. Return the total count of unique characters

Let me trace through the examples:
- 'xyzXYZ': characters are x, y, z, X, Y, Z. Since we ignore case, we have {x, y, z} = 3 distinct characters
- 'Jerry': characters are J, e, r, r, y. Ignoring case: {j, e, r, y} = 4 distinct characters

My approach:
1. Convert the string to lowercase to make it case-insensitive
2. Use a set to automatically handle uniqueness
3. Return the length of the set

```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of
    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
    3
    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
    4
    """
    return len(set(string.lower()))
```
