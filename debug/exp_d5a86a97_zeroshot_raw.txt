Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Start with a balance of 0
2. Process each operation in the list (adding deposits, subtracting withdrawals)
3. After each operation, check if the balance falls below zero
4. If it does, return True immediately
5. If I process all operations without the balance going below zero, return False

Let me trace through the examples:
- `[1, 2, 3]`: balance goes 0→1→3→6, never below zero → False
- `[1, 2, -4, 5]`: balance goes 0→1→3→-1, falls below zero at -1 → True

```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
