To implement the `median` function, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Sort the List**: The first step is to sort the list of numbers. This is necessary because the median is the middle value in a sorted list.
2. **Find the Middle Element(s)**:
   - If the number of elements (`n`) is odd, the median is the element at index `n // 2`.
   - If `n` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements, which are at indices `n // 2 - 1` and `n // 2`.

Let's implement this logic in the function.

```python
def median(l: list):
    """Return median of elements in the list l."""
    sorted_l = sorted(l)
    n = len(sorted_l)
    mid = n // 2
    
    if n % 2 == 1:
        return sorted_l[mid]
    else:
        return (sorted_l[mid - 1] + sorted_l[mid]) / 2
```
