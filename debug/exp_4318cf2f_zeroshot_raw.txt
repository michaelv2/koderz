To determine if three sides form a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right-angled triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and hypotenuse \(c\) (where \(c\) is the longest side), the following equation holds:

\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]

We need to check all possible combinations of sides to see if any one of them satisfies this equation. Here's how we can implement this in Python:

```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Sort the sides to ensure c is the longest side
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    
    # Check the Pythagorean theorem
    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2
```

This function first sorts the sides of the triangle to ensure that the longest side is \(c\). Then it checks if the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the longest side. If it does, the triangle is a right-angled triangle; otherwise, it is not.
