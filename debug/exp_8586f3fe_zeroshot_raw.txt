To solve this problem, we need to parse a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces. For each group, we need to determine the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.

Here's a step-by-step approach:
1. Split the input string into individual groups based on spaces.
2. For each group, initialize a counter for the current depth and another counter for the maximum depth encountered.
3. Iterate through each character in the group:
   - If the character is an opening parenthesis '(', increment the current depth and update the maximum depth if necessary.
   - If the character is a closing parenthesis ')', decrement the current depth.
4. Append the maximum depth for each group to the result list.

```python
def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    E.g. (()()) has maximum two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.

    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
    result = []
    groups = paren_string.split()
    
    for group in groups:
        current_depth = 0
        max_depth = 0
        
        for char in group:
            if char == '(':
                current_depth += 1
                max_depth = max(max_depth, current_depth)
            elif char == ')':
                current_depth -= 1
        
        result.append(max_depth)
    
    return result
```
