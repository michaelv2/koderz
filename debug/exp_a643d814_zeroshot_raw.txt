Let me think through this:

1. I need to count even and odd digits in an integer
2. For negative numbers, I should ignore the sign and just look at the digits
3. A digit is even if it's divisible by 2 (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
4. A digit is odd if it's not divisible by 2 (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
5. Return a tuple of (even_count, odd_count)

For example:
- `-12`: digits are 1 and 2. 1 is odd, 2 is even → (1, 1)
- `123`: digits are 1, 2, 3. 1 is odd, 2 is even, 3 is odd → (1, 2)

```python
def even_odd_count(num):
    """Given an integer. return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.

     Example:
        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)
        even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)
    """
    # Convert to string and remove the negative sign if present
    digits_str = str(abs(num))
    
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Count even and odd digits
    for digit_char in digits_str:
        digit = int(digit_char)
        if digit % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    
    return (even_count, odd_count)
```
