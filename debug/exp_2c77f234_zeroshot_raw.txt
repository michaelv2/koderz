To solve this problem, we need to perform two main operations on the input message:
1. Swap the case of all letters.
2. Replace each vowel with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of it in the English alphabet.

Here's how we can achieve this:
- We'll iterate through each character in the message.
- For each character, we'll first swap its case using the `swapcase()` method.
- If the swapped character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), we'll replace it with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of it. This can be done by converting the character to its ASCII value, adding 2, and then converting it back to a character.

Let's implement this in the `encode` function:

```python
def encode(message):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    encoded_message = []
    
    for char in message:
        swapped_char = char.swapcase()
        if swapped_char in vowels:
            # Find the ASCII value, add 2, and convert back to character
            new_char = chr(ord(swapped_char) + 2)
            encoded_message.append(new_char)
        else:
            encoded_message.append(swapped_char)
    
    return ''.join(encoded_message)
```
