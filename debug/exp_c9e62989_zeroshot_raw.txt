Let me analyze this problem:

1. Sort an array by the number of 1s in binary representation (ascending)
2. For numbers with the same count of 1s, sort by decimal value (ascending)
3. Handle negative numbers appropriately

For negative numbers in Python, `bin()` shows them as `-0b...`, so I need to count 1s in the binary representation carefully.

Key observations:
- For positive numbers: count 1s in binary representation
- For negative numbers: Python uses two's complement internally, but `bin()` shows a minus sign. I need to handle this carefully.
- Actually, looking at the examples with negative numbers, it seems like we should count 1s in the absolute value's binary representation, or use Python's bit_count() which handles this correctly.

Let me trace through the examples:
1. `[1, 5, 2, 3, 4]`: 
   - 1 = 0b1 (1 one)
   - 5 = 0b101 (2 ones)
   - 2 = 0b10 (1 one)
   - 3 = 0b11 (2 ones)
   - 4 = 0b100 (1 one)
   - Grouped by ones: [1,2,4] (1 one), [3,5] (2 ones) → sorted by value within groups → [1,2,4,3,5] then [3,5] → [1,2,3,4,5] ✓

2. `[-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]`: Expected `[-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]` (sorted by decimal value)
   - This suggests negative numbers might all have different counts of 1s, or we count in a specific way

For Python 3.10+, `int.bit_count()` works on positive integers. For negative numbers, we might need to use `bin(n).count('1')` approach or handle two's complement.

Let me use a sorting key that:
1. First sorts by count of 1s in binary
2. Then by the number itself

```python
def sort_array(arr):
    def count_ones(n):
        if n >= 0:
            return bin(n).count('1')
        else:
            # For negative numbers, count 1s in two's complement representation
            # Python's bin() for negative shows -0b..., so we count from abs
            # Actually, for negative numbers in two's complement, we need special handling
            # Let's use bit_length to handle this properly
            return bin(n).count('1')
    
    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (count_ones(x), x))
```

Actually, `bin()` for negative numbers in Python shows the sign separately, so `bin(-5).count('1')` counts 1s in the magnitude. This should work for the given examples.

```python
def sort_array(arr):
    def count_ones(n):
        return bin(n).count('1')
    
    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (count_ones(x), x))
```
