To solve this problem, we need to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n-1`.
2. Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13.
3. If it is, convert the number to a string and count the occurrences of '7'.
4. Sum up all these counts and return the total.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            count += str(i).count('7')
    return count
```

This function iterates through each number from 1 to `n-1`, checks the divisibility by 11 or 13, and counts the occurrences of '7' in those numbers. The total count is then returned.
