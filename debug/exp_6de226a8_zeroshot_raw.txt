Looking at this problem, I need to determine if three given side lengths can form a right-angled triangle.

The key mathematical principle here is the Pythagorean theorem: in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (longest side) equals the sum of squares of the other two sides.

My approach:
1. First, I need to identify which side is the longest (potential hypotenuse)
2. Then check if the square of the longest side equals the sum of squares of the other two sides
3. I should also verify that all sides are positive numbers (since negative lengths don't make sense for triangles)

Let me trace through the examples:
- For (3, 4, 5): 5² = 25, and 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25. So 25 = 25, which is True
- For (1, 2, 3): 3² = 9, and 1² + 2² = 1 + 4 = 5. So 9 ≠ 5, which is False

```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Check if all sides are positive
    if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:
        return False
    
    # Sort the sides to identify the longest side
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    
    # Check if Pythagorean theorem holds: a² + b² = c²
    # where c is the longest side
    return abs(sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 - sides[2]**2) < 1e-10
```
