 The problem is asking to check whether all numbers in a given list are below a certain threshold. To solve this, we can iterate through the list and return False as soon as we find a number that is not below the threshold. If we finish iterating through the list without finding such a number, we can return True.

Here's my plan:
1. Define a function `below_threshold` that takes in a list `l` and an integer `t`.
2. Iterate through each element `num` in the list.
3. If `num` is not less than `t`, return False.
4. If we finish iterating through the list without finding any number that is not below the threshold, return True.

Now I'll write and execute the Python code for this function.
```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    for num in l:
        if num >= t:
            return False
    return True
```
