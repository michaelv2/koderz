 The problem is asking to create a Python function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to `n` inclusive.

To solve this problem, I will use the built-in `range()` function in Python to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n`. Then, I will join these numbers into a single string with spaces as delimiters using the `join()` method.

Here is my solution:

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n + 1)))
```
