To solve this problem, we need to check if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring of the first word. A rotation of a string can be generated by moving characters from the start of the string to the end one at a time.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Generate all rotations of the second word.
2. Check if any of these rotations is a substring of the first word.
3. Return `True` if any rotation is found as a substring, otherwise return `False`.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    # Generate all rotations of b
    rotations = [b[i:] + b[:i] for i in range(len(b))]
    
    # Check if any rotation is a substring of a
    for rotation in rotations:
        if rotation in a:
            return True
    return False
```
