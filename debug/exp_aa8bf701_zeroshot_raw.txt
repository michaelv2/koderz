Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Take a list of numbers as input
2. Return a new list where each element is incremented by 1

This is a straightforward transformation using a list comprehension or map function.

```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1.
    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 3, 4]
    >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
    """
    return [x + 1 for x in l]
```
