To solve this problem, we need to identify all integer palindromes within the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and count how many of them are even and how many are odd.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Generate Palindromes**: We need a function to check if a number is a palindrome.
2. **Count Even and Odd Palindromes**: Iterate through the range from 1 to `n`, use the palindrome-checking function, and count even and odd palindromes separately.

Let's implement this:

```python
def is_palindrome(num):
    return str(num) == str(num)[::-1]

def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if is_palindrome(i):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1
                
    return (even_count, odd_count)
```

### Explanation:

1. **is_palindrome Function**: This function checks if a given number `num` is a palindrome by converting it to a string and comparing it to its reverse.
2. **even_odd_palindrome Function**:
   - Initialize counters for even and odd palindromes.
   - Iterate through each number from 1 to `n`.
   - Use the `is_palindrome` function to check if the current number is a palindrome.
   - If it is, increment the appropriate counter based on whether the number is even or odd.
   - Finally, return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd palindromes.
