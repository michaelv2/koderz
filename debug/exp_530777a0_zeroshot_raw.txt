Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Find all prime numbers less than n
2. Return them in a list

I'll use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for efficiency, which is a classic method for finding all primes up to a given number.

The algorithm works by:
- Marking 0 and 1 as not prime
- Iterating through each number and marking its multiples as not prime
- Collecting all numbers that remain marked as prime

```python
def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
    for example:
    count_up_to(5) => [2,3]
    count_up_to(11) => [2,3,5,7]
    count_up_to(0) => []
    count_up_to(20) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]
    count_up_to(1) => []
    count_up_to(18) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]
    """
    if n <= 2:
        return []
    
    # Create a boolean array "prime[0..n-1]" and initialize all as true
    prime = [True] * n
    prime[0] = prime[1] = False  # 0 and 1 are not prime
    
    # Sieve of Eratosthenes
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if prime[i]:
            # Mark all multiples of i as not prime
            for j in range(i*i, n, i):
                prime[j] = False
    
    # Collect all prime numbers
    return [i for i in range(n) if prime[i]]
```
