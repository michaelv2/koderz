Looking at this problem, I need to understand how `encode_shift` works:

1. It takes each character, converts it to its position in the alphabet (0-25)
2. Adds 5 to that position
3. Uses modulo 26 to wrap around
4. Converts back to a character

To decode, I need to reverse this process:
1. Take each character and convert it to its position (0-25)
2. **Subtract 5** instead of adding 5 (to reverse the shift)
3. Use modulo 26 to handle negative wrapping
4. Convert back to a character

For example:
- 'a' (position 0) encoded becomes position (0+5)%26 = 5 = 'f'
- 'f' (position 5) decoded should become (5-5)%26 = 0 = 'a' ✓

```python
def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])
```
