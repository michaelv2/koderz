Let me reason through this problem:

1. A palindromic array reads the same forwards and backwards
2. We need to find the minimum number of changes to make it palindromic
3. To check if an array is palindromic, we compare elements at position `i` with position `n-1-i`
4. If they don't match, we need to change one of them (counts as 1 change)
5. We only need to check the first half of the array, since each mismatch involves a pair

The approach:
- Compare elements from the start and end moving towards the middle
- For each pair that doesn't match, increment the counter
- Stop when we reach the middle

```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    changes = 0
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        if arr[left] != arr[right]:
            changes += 1
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    
    return changes
```
