Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Replace all spaces with underscores
2. Replace sequences of MORE than 2 consecutive spaces with a single dash

Let me trace through the examples:
- "Example" → "Example" (no spaces)
- "Example 1" → "Example_1" (one space becomes underscore)
- " Example 2" → "_Example_2" (one leading space becomes underscore)
- " Example   3" → "_Example-3" (one space + three spaces becomes underscore + dash)

I need to handle the consecutive spaces replacement first, then the single spaces.

```python
import re

def fix_spaces(text):
    # First, replace sequences of 3 or more spaces with a single dash
    text = re.sub(r' {3,}', '-', text)
    # Then, replace remaining single spaces with underscores
    text = text.replace(' ', '_')
    return text
```
