Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Count vowels in a string ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
2. Count 'y' as a vowel only when it's at the end of the word
3. Handle case insensitivity

Let me trace through the examples:
- `vowels_count("abcde")` should return 2: 'a' and 'e' are vowels
- `vowels_count("ACEDY")` should return 3: 'A', 'E', and 'Y' (at the end) are vowels

```python
def vowels_count(s):
    if not s:
        return 0
    
    vowels = set('aeiou')
    count = 0
    s_lower = s.lower()
    
    for i, char in enumerate(s_lower):
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1
        elif char == 'y' and i == len(s_lower) - 1:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```
