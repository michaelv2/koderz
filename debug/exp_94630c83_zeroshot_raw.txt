To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each row of the given 2D list `lst` and find all occurrences of the integer `x`. For each occurrence, we record its coordinates as a tuple `(row_index, column_index)`. After collecting all such tuples, we sort them first by row index in ascending order and then by column index in descending order for entries within the same row.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def get_row(lst, x):
    coordinates = []
    for i, row in enumerate(lst):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == x:
                coordinates.append((i, j))
    # Sort by row index ascending, then by column index descending
    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    return coordinates
```
