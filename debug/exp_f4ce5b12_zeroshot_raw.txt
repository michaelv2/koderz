Looking at this problem, I need to check if any two numbers in the list have a distance less than the given threshold.

Let me think through the approach:
1. I need to compare every pair of numbers in the list
2. For each pair, calculate the absolute difference
3. If any difference is less than the threshold, return True
4. If no pairs are closer than the threshold, return False

I'll use nested loops to check all pairs, but I can optimize by only checking pairs where the first index is less than the second index to avoid duplicate comparisons.

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```
