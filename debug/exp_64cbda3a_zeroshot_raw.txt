To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each element in the list `l` and check if it is below the threshold `t`. If all elements satisfy this condition, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Iterate over each element in the list `l`.
2. For each element, check if it is less than `t`.
3. If any element is found to be greater than or equal to `t`, immediately return `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any such element, return `True`.

This approach ensures that we stop checking as soon as we find an element that does not meet the condition, which can save time in cases where the list is long and a disqualifying element is found early.

```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int):
    """Return True if all numbers in the list l are below threshold t."""
    for num in l:
        if num >= t:
            return False
    return True
```
