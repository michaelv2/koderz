To solve the problem of finding the second smallest element in a list, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Remove Duplicates**: Since we are interested in the second smallest unique element, we should first remove any duplicate values from the list.
2. **Sort the List**: Sorting the list will help us easily identify the second smallest element.
3. **Check Length**: If the sorted list has fewer than two elements, it means there is no second smallest element, so we return `None`.
4. **Return the Second Element**: Otherwise, we return the second element in the sorted list.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    # Remove duplicates by converting the list to a set and back to a list
    unique_lst = list(set(lst))
    
    # Sort the list
    unique_lst.sort()
    
    # Check if there are at least two elements
    if len(unique_lst) < 2:
        return None
    
    # Return the second smallest element
    return unique_lst[1]
```

This function first removes any duplicate values from the input list, then sorts the remaining unique values. If there are fewer than two unique values, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the second smallest value in the sorted list.
