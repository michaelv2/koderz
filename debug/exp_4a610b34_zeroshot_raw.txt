To solve this problem, we need to break down the sentence into words, check the length of each word, and determine if that length is a prime number. If it is, we include the word in our result. The order of words should be preserved.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Split the sentence into individual words.
2. Create a helper function to check if a number is prime.
3. Iterate over each word, check its length, and use the helper function to determine if the length is prime.
4. Collect all words with prime lengths.
5. Join these words back into a single string separated by spaces.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """Return a string of words from the sentence with prime lengths."""
    words = sentence.split()
    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return ' '.join(prime_length_words)
```
