To solve the problem of flipping the case of each character in a given string, we can utilize Python's built-in string method `swapcase()`. This method is specifically designed to convert all lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. We need to process each character in the input string.
2. For each character, if it is lowercase, we should convert it to uppercase.
3. If it is uppercase, we should convert it to lowercase.
4. Python provides a convenient method `swapcase()` that performs exactly this operation on strings.

Given this, the implementation of the function `flip_case` becomes straightforward by simply calling `swapcase()` on the input string.

```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    """ For a given string, flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase. """
    return string.swapcase()
```
