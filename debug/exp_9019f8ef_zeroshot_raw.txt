Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Remove all vowels (both lowercase and uppercase: a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U)
2. Keep all other characters including consonants, digits, spaces, and newlines
3. Handle edge cases like empty strings

The approach is straightforward: iterate through the string and keep only characters that are not vowels.

```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    remove_vowels is a function that takes string and returns string without vowels.
    >>> remove_vowels('')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")
    'bcdf\nghjklm'
    >>> remove_vowels('abcdef')
    'bcdf'
    >>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')
    'B'
    >>> remove_vowels('zbcd')
    'zbcd'
    """
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    return ''.join(char for char in text if char not in vowels)
```
