To solve this problem, we need to sort an array of non-negative integers based on the number of ones in their binary representation. If two numbers have the same number of ones, they should be sorted by their decimal value.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Convert each number to its binary representation.
2. Count the number of ones in the binary representation.
3. Sort the array primarily based on the count of ones and secondarily based on the decimal value.

However, the problem statement includes negative numbers in the examples, which seems inconsistent with the description of non-negative integers. I'll assume the function should handle both positive and negative numbers, sorting negatives separately as shown in the examples.

For negative numbers, since they are not non-negative, we can sort them in descending order based on their absolute values to match the given example output.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def sort_array(arr):
    # Separate non-negative and negative numbers
    non_negatives = [x for x in arr if x >= 0]
    negatives = [x for x in arr if x < 0]
    
    # Sort non-negatives by number of ones in binary representation, then by value
    non_negatives_sorted = sorted(non_negatives, key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x))
    
    # Sort negatives in descending order based on their absolute values
    negatives_sorted = sorted(negatives, key=abs, reverse=True)
    
    # Combine the sorted lists
    return negatives_sorted + non_negatives_sorted
```

This code handles both positive and negative numbers as described in the examples.
