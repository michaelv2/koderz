Looking at this problem, I need to:

1. Define the order of planets from the Sun
2. Find the positions of the two input planets
3. Return all planets between those positions
4. Handle invalid planet names by returning an empty tuple
5. Handle cases where the first planet is farther from the Sun than the second

Let me trace through the examples:
- bf("Jupiter", "Neptune"): Jupiter is at index 4, Neptune at index 7, so planets between are Saturn(5) and Uranus(6) → ("Saturn", "Uranus")
- bf("Earth", "Mercury"): Earth is at index 3, Mercury at index 0, so planets between are Venus(1) → ("Venus")
- bf("Mercury", "Uranus"): Mercury at index 0, Uranus at index 6, so planets between are Venus(1), Earth(2), Mars(3), Jupiter(4), Saturn(5) → ("Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn")

```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]
    
    try:
        index1 = planets.index(planet1)
        index2 = planets.index(planet2)
    except ValueError:
        return ()
    
    # If same planet, return empty tuple
    if index1 == index2:
        return ()
    
    # Get the range between the two planets
    start_index = min(index1, index2)
    end_index = max(index1, index2)
    
    # Return planets between (exclusive of the input planets)
    return tuple(planets[start_index + 1:end_index])
```
