To solve this problem, we need to iterate through all integers less than `n` and check if they are divisible by either 11 or 13. If they are, we convert the number to a string and count how many times the digit '7' appears in that string. We then sum up these counts to get the final result.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            count += str(i).count('7')
    return count
```
