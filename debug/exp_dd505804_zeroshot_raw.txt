Looking at this problem, I need to find the minimum number of changes to make an array palindromic.

Key insights:
1. In a palindrome, elements at symmetric positions must be equal
2. For an array of length n, I need to compare arr[i] with arr[n-1-i] for i from 0 to n//2
3. For each pair that doesn't match, I need exactly one change (I can change either element to match the other)
4. If the array has odd length, the middle element doesn't need to be changed since it's its own mirror

Let me trace through the examples:
- [1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]: Compare (1,6), (2,9), (3,7), (5,4) - all different, so 4 changes needed
- [1,2,3,4,3,2,2]: Compare (1,2), (2,2), (3,3) - first pair different, so 1 change needed  
- [1,2,3,2,1]: Compare (1,1), (2,2) - all match, so 0 changes needed

```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    changes = 0
    
    # Compare elements from both ends moving towards center
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if arr[i] != arr[n - 1 - i]:
            changes += 1
    
    return changes
```
