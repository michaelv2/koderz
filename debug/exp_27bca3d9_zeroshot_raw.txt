To solve this problem, we need to check if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character and ensure that it is not part of a word. This means the last character should be isolated by spaces or the string should end right after this character without any trailing spaces.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Strip any trailing spaces from the string.
2. Check if the resulting string is empty. If it is, return False.
3. Split the string into words.
4. Check if the last word is a single alphabetical character.
5. Return True if the last word is a single alphabetical character, otherwise return False.

```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    txt = txt.rstrip()
    if not txt:
        return False
    words = txt.split()
    return len(words[-1]) == 1 and words[-1].isalpha()
```
