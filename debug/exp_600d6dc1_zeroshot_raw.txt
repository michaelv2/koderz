To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Split the input sentence into individual words.
2. Check the length of each word to determine if it is a prime number.
3. Collect words whose lengths are prime numbers.
4. Join these words back into a single string and return it.

Here's the Python function implementation:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """Return a string containing words from the original sentence whose lengths are prime numbers."""
    words = sentence.split()
    prime_length_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return ' '.join(prime_length_words)
```

### Explanation:
1. **is_prime(n)**: This helper function checks if a number `n` is prime. It handles small numbers directly and uses a loop to check divisibility for larger numbers.
2. **words_in_sentence(sentence)**: This function splits the input sentence into words, filters out the words whose lengths are not prime using a list comprehension, and then joins these filtered words back into a single string.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify and return words with prime number lengths while maintaining their original order in the sentence.
