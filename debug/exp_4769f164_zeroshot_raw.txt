Let me break down this problem:

1. I need to count how many numbers in the array have a sum of digits > 0
2. For negative numbers, only the first digit is negative, and the rest are positive
3. Examples:
   - `-1`: sum = -1 (not > 0)
   - `11`: sum = 1 + 1 = 2 (> 0)
   - `-11`: sum = -1 + 1 = 0 (not > 0)
   - `1`: sum = 1 (> 0)
   - `2`: sum = 2 (> 0)

My approach:
1. Iterate through each number in the array
2. For each number, calculate the sum of its digits with the rule that the first digit is negative if the number is negative
3. Count how many have sum > 0

```python
def count_nums(arr):
    count = 0
    for num in arr:
        # Convert to string to access digits
        s = str(num)
        digit_sum = 0
        
        if s[0] == '-':
            # Negative number: first digit is negative, rest are positive
            digit_sum -= int(s[1])  # First digit (after minus sign) is negative
            for digit in s[2:]:
                digit_sum += int(digit)
        else:
            # Positive number: all digits are positive
            for digit in s:
                digit_sum += int(digit)
        
        if digit_sum > 0:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```
