Looking at this problem, I need to implement a function that returns the n-th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ... where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

Let me trace through the examples:
- fib(1) = 1
- fib(8) = 21
- fib(10) = 55

I can implement this using either an iterative approach or a recursive approach. The iterative approach is more efficient for larger values of n.

I'll use an iterative approach with two variables to keep track of the last two Fibonacci numbers, updating them until we reach the n-th number.

```python
def fib(n: int):
    """Return n-th Fibonacci number.
    >>> fib(10)
    55
    >>> fib(1)
    1
    >>> fib(8)
    21
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    
    a, b = 1, 1
    for _ in range(3, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    return b
```
