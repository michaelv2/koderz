To decode the cyclically encoded string, we need to reverse the process of the `encode_cyclic` function. Specifically, for each group of three characters, we need to move the first character to the end of the group. If a group has fewer than three characters, it remains unchanged.

Here's the implementation of the `decode_cyclic` function:

```python
def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # cycle elements in each group back. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)
```
