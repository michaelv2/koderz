 The problem is about creating an encryption function that takes a string as input and returns the encrypted version of the string by shifting each letter down by two multiplied to two places in the alphabet.

To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string, convert it to its ASCII value, apply the rotation formula (adding 2 * 2 to the ASCII value), and then converting it back to a character. If the character is not a lowercase letter, we leave it as is.

Here's the Python function that implements this solution:

```python
def encrypt(s):
    result = ""
    for char in s:
        if 'a' <= char <= 'z':
            result += chr((ord(char) - ord('a') + 2 * 2) % 26 + ord('a'))
        else:
            result += char
    return result
```
