To solve the problem of checking if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, we can use a stack data structure. The stack will help us keep track of the opening brackets as we encounter them and ensure that each one is properly closed.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through each character in the input string.
3. If the character is an opening bracket '(', push it onto the stack.
4. If the character is a closing bracket ')':
   - Check if the stack is not empty (meaning there's an unmatched opening bracket).
   - Pop the top element from the stack.
5. After iterating through the string, check if the stack is empty. If it is, all brackets are correctly matched; otherwise, there are unmatched opening brackets.

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    
    return len(stack) == 0
```
