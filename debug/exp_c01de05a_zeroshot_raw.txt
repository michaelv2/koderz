Looking at this problem, I need to check if brackets are properly matched. I'll use a counter approach:

1. Initialize a counter to 0
2. Iterate through each character in the string
3. For each "(", increment the counter
4. For each ")", decrement the counter
5. If the counter ever goes negative, it means we have more closing brackets than opening brackets up to that point, so return False
6. At the end, the counter should be exactly 0 for properly matched brackets

Let me trace through the examples:
- "(": counter goes from 0 to 1, never negative, but ends at 1 (not 0) → False
- "()": counter goes 0→1→0, never negative, ends at 0 → True  
- "(()())": counter goes 0→1→2→1→2→1→0, never negative, ends at 0 → True
- ")(()": counter goes 0→-1 (negative!) → False

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "(" and ")".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("(")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("()")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
    False
    """
    counter = 0
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            counter += 1
        elif bracket == ")":
            counter -= 1
            if counter < 0:
                return False
    return counter == 0
```
