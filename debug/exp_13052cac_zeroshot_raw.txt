To solve the problem of sorting a list in a "strange" order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the minimum value from the list.
2. Then take the maximum value from the remaining elements.
3. Continue this process alternately taking the minimum and maximum values until all elements are selected.

Here's how we can implement this logic in Python:

```python
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    sorted_list = []
    lst.sort()  # Sort the list to easily access min and max
    
    while lst:
        if sorted_list:  # If there's already an element in the result, take the maximum
            sorted_list.append(lst.pop())
        else:  # Otherwise, take the minimum
            sorted_list.append(lst.pop(0))
    
    return sorted_list
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting the List**: We first sort the list to make it easier to access the minimum and maximum values.
2. **Using a While Loop**: We use a while loop to repeatedly select elements from the sorted list.
3. **Alternating Selection**:
   - If `sorted_list` already has an element, we pop the last element (which is the current maximum) from the original list and append it to `sorted_list`.
   - If `sorted_list` is empty, we pop the first element (which is the current minimum) from the original list and append it to `sorted_list`.

This approach ensures that we alternate between taking the minimum and maximum values as required.
