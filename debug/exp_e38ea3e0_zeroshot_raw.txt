To solve this problem, we need to check if any two numbers in the given list are closer to each other than the specified threshold. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Sort the List**: Sorting the list will help us only compare each number with its immediate neighbor, which simplifies the problem.
2. **Compare Adjacent Elements**: After sorting, we can iterate through the list and check the difference between each pair of adjacent elements.
3. **Check Threshold**: If any difference is less than the threshold, return `True`. If no such pair is found, return `False`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find if there are any two numbers closer than the given threshold.

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """
    numbers.sort()
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1]) < threshold:
            return True
    return False
```
