Looking at this problem, I need to figure out how many collisions occur when n cars move left to right and n cars move right to left.

Let me think through this step by step:

1. We have n cars moving left to right
2. We have n cars moving right to left
3. All cars move at the same speed
4. Each car moving left to right will eventually meet and collide with every car moving right to left
5. Since the cars are infinitely sturdy, they continue moving after collision

The key insight is that every car moving left to right will collide with every car moving right to left exactly once. This is because:
- The cars are moving toward each other
- They start far apart
- They move at the same speed
- They will all eventually meet

So the total number of collisions = n (left to right cars) × n (right to left cars) = n²

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
    """
    return n * n
