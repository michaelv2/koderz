To solve the problem of changing the base of a given integer `x` to another base `base`, we can use a simple iterative approach. The idea is to repeatedly divide the number by the new base and keep track of the remainders. These remainders will form the digits of the new base representation, starting from least significant to most significant.

Here's the step-by-step process:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the remainders.
2. While `x` is greater than 0, divide `x` by `base`, append the remainder to the list, and update `x` to be the quotient of the division.
3. Reverse the list of remainders to get the correct order.
4. Join the list of remainders into a string and return it.

```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
    if x == 0:
        return "0"
    
    digits = []
    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % base
        digits.append(str(remainder))
        x = x // base
    
    # Reverse the list of digits and join them into a string
    return ''.join(digits[::-1])
```
