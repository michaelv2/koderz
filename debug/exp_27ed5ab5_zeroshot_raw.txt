To determine if a number `n` is prime, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. A straightforward approach is to test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime.
2. If `n` is 2, it is prime (since 2 is the smallest and only even prime number).
3. For any other even number greater than 2, it is not prime.
4. For odd numbers greater than 2, check divisibility from 3 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the primality of a number with minimal checks.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
