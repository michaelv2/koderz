To solve this problem, we need to extract the decimal part of a given positive floating point number. The decimal part is what remains after removing the integer part from the number. In Python, we can achieve this by using the `math.modf` function, which returns the fractional and integer parts of a number as a tuple. Alternatively, we can use simple arithmetic operations to isolate the decimal part.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. We take the input floating point number.
2. We subtract the integer part of the number from the original number.
3. The result is the decimal part of the number.

We can use the `int()` function to get the integer part of a float, as it truncates the decimal portion.

Let's implement this in code:

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    an integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    """
    return number - int(number)
```
