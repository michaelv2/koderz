To reverse the transformation performed by `encode_cyclic`, we need to understand how the encoding process works and then apply the inverse operations.

### Reasoning:
1. **Grouping**: The input string is split into groups of three characters.
2. **Cyclic Shift**: Each group of exactly three characters is cyclically shifted left by one position (the first character moves to the end).
3. **Handling Short Groups**: Groups with fewer than three characters are left unchanged.

### Decoding Steps:
1. **Grouping**: Split the encoded string into groups of three characters, similar to the encoding process.
2. **Inverse Cyclic Shift**: For each group of exactly three characters, perform a cyclic shift right by one position (the last character moves to the front).
3. **Handling Short Groups**: Leave groups with fewer than three characters unchanged.

### Implementation:
- We will iterate over the string in chunks of three characters.
- For each chunk of length 3, we will move the last character to the front.
- Chunks shorter than 3 characters will remain unchanged.
- Finally, we concatenate all the processed chunks to form the decoded string.

```python
def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    # split string into groups of three characters
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # perform inverse cyclic shift on each group of length 3
    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)
```
