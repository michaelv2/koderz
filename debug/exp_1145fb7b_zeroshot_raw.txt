 The problem is about writing a Python function that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels in the string. Vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and 'y' when it is at the end of the given word.

Here is my approach to solve this problem:
1. Convert the input string to lowercase to handle both uppercase and lowercase vowels.
2. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of vowels in the string.
3. Iterate through each character in the string.
4. If the character is a vowel, increment the counter.
5. Additionally, check if the current character is 'y' and it is at the end of the word. If so, increment the counter.
6. Return the final count of vowels.

Here is my Python function implementation:

```python
def vowels_count(s):
    s = s.lower()
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in 'aeiou':
            count += 1
        elif s[i] == 'y' and i == len(s) - 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
