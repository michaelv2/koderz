 The problem is asking to calculate the sum and product of all elements in a given list of integers. If the list is empty, the sum should be 0 and the product should be 1.

Here's how I plan to solve this:
- Initialize two variables `sum_val` and `product_val` to 0 and 1 respectively.
- Iterate over each number in the input list.
- For each number, add it to `sum_val` and multiply it with `product_val`.
- Finally, return a tuple of `sum_val` and `product_val`.

Now I'll write the Python function for this.
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    sum_val = 0
    product_val = 1
    for num in numbers:
        sum_val += num
        product_val *= num
    return (sum_val, product_val)
```
