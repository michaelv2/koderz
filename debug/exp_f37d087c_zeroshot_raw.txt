Problem analysis
- Core task: Remove from s every character that appears in c, preserving the order of the remaining characters, then check if the resulting string is a palindrome.
- Constraints: c defines a set of characters to delete (duplicates in c are irrelevant). Handle empty results (empty string is considered a palindrome). Case sensitivity matters.

Implementation specification
- Function signature: reverse_delete(s, c)
- Steps:
  - Build a set of characters to delete from c.
  - Filter s by keeping characters not in that set.
  - Check palindrome by comparing the filtered string to its reverse.
- Return: A tuple (filtered_string, is_palindrome_bool)

```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    delete_set = set(c)
    filtered = ''.join(ch for ch in s if ch not in delete_set)
    return filtered, filtered == filtered[::-1]
```
