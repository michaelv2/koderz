Let me think through this problem:

1. We need to check if a number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
2. The smallest positive even number is 2
3. So the minimum sum of 4 positive even numbers is 2+2+2+2 = 8
4. Any number less than 8 cannot be expressed as such a sum
5. For numbers >= 8, we need to check if we can express them as a sum of 4 positive even numbers

Key insight: If n can be written as sum of 4 positive even numbers, we can write:
- n = 2a + 2b + 2c + 2d where a,b,c,d are positive integers
- n = 2(a+b+c+d)
- This means n must be even
- And a+b+c+d must be positive integers that sum to n/2
- Since a,b,c,d are at least 1 each, we need a+b+c+d >= 4
- So n/2 >= 4, which means n >= 8

Therefore:
- n must be even
- n must be >= 8

Let me verify with examples:
- is_equal_to_sum_even(4): 4 is even but 4 < 8, so False ✓
- is_equal_to_sum_even(6): 6 is even but 6 < 8, so False ✓
- is_equal_to_sum_even(8): 8 is even and 8 >= 8, so True ✓ (can be 2+2+2+2)
- is_equal_to_sum_even(10): 10 is even and 10 >= 8, so True (can be 2+2+2+4)

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers"""
    return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0
```
