To solve the problem of sorting the list in a "strange" order, we can follow these steps:
1. Continuously find and remove the minimum value from the list and add it to the result.
2. Then find and remove the maximum value from the remaining list and add it to the result.
3. Repeat the process until the list is empty.

This approach ensures that we alternate between picking the smallest and largest available elements, achieving the desired "strange" order.

```python
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    result = []
    while lst:
        # Append the minimum value
        min_val = min(lst)
        lst.remove(min_val)
        result.append(min_val)
        
        # Check if list is empty after removing min
        if not lst:
            break
        
        # Append the maximum value
        max_val = max(lst)
        lst.remove(max_val)
        result.append(max_val)
    
    return result
```
