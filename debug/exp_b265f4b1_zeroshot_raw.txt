To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Filter the array to include only integers between 1 and 9 inclusive.
2. Sort the filtered list.
3. Reverse the sorted list.
4. Map each integer to its corresponding name using a predefined mapping.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def by_length(arr):
    # Define the mapping from numbers to their names
    num_to_name = {
        1: "One",
        2: "Two",
        3: "Three",
        4: "Four",
        5: "Five",
        6: "Six",
        7: "Seven",
        8: "Eight",
        9: "Nine"
    }
    
    # Filter the array to include only numbers between 1 and 9
    filtered = [x for x in arr if 1 <= x <= 9]
    
    # Sort the filtered list
    sorted_filtered = sorted(filtered)
    
    # Reverse the sorted list
    reversed_sorted = sorted_filtered[::-1]
    
    # Map each number to its corresponding name
    result = [num_to_name[x] for x in reversed_sorted]
    
    return result
```
