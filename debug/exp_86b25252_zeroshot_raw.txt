 The problem requires us to delete all characters from string `s` that are present in string `c`, and then check if the resulting string is a palindrome. To solve this, we can follow these steps:

1. Create an empty string `result`.
2. Iterate over each character `char` in string `s`.
3. If `char` is not present in string `c`, append it to `result`.
4. Check if `result` is equal to its reverse (`result[::-1]`). If yes, return a tuple containing `result` and `True`. Otherwise, return a tuple containing `result` and `False`.

Here's the Python function that implements this:

```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    result = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in c])
    return (result, result == result[::-1])
```
