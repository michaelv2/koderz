To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the list of operations and keep a running total of the balance. If at any point this running total falls below zero, we should return `True`. If we finish processing all operations without the balance falling below zero, we should return `False`.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current balance, starting at 0.
2. Iterate through each operation in the list.
3. Update the balance by adding the current operation value.
4. Check if the balance is less than zero after updating. If it is, return `True`.
5. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, return `False`.

Let's implement this logic in the function:

```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
