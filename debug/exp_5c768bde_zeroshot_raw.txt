I need to create a function that finds the nth number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number.

Let me think through this step by step:

1. First, I need a way to generate Fibonacci numbers
2. Then, I need a way to check if a number is prime
3. Finally, I need to find the nth Fibonacci number that is also prime

Let me trace through the examples:
- prime_fib(1) = 2 (2 is the 1st Fibonacci number and it's prime)
- prime_fib(2) = 3 (3 is the 4th Fibonacci number and it's prime)
- prime_fib(3) = 5 (5 is the 5th Fibonacci number and it's prime)
- prime_fib(4) = 13 (13 is the 7th Fibonacci number and it's prime)
- prime_fib(5) = 89 (89 is the 11th Fibonacci number and it's prime)

So I need to:
1. Generate Fibonacci numbers in sequence
2. Check each one for primality
3. Count the prime Fibonacci numbers
4. Return the nth one

```python
def prime_fib(n: int):
    def is_prime(num):
        if num < 2:
            return False
        if num == 2:
            return True
        if num % 2 == 0:
            return False
        for i in range(3, int(num**0.5) + 1, 2):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    a, b = 0, 1
    count = 0
    
    while True:
        a, b = b, a + b
        if is_prime(a):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return a
```
