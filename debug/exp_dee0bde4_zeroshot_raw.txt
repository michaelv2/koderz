Looking at this problem, I need to implement a function that returns the length of a given string. The function should handle both empty strings and strings with characters.

The function signature is `strlen(string: str) -> int` which means it takes a string parameter and returns an integer representing the length.

Looking at the examples:
- `strlen('')` should return `0` (empty string)
- `strlen('abc')` should return `3` (3 characters)

In Python, I can use the built-in `len()` function to get the length of a string, or I can implement it manually by iterating through the string and counting characters.

Since this is a straightforward problem and Python's `len()` function is already optimized, I'll use it directly.

```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    """
    return len(string)
```
