To solve this problem, we need to determine if any two numbers in the given list are closer to each other than the specified threshold. A straightforward approach is to compare each pair of numbers in the list and check their absolute difference.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. We will iterate through each element in the list.
2. For each element, we will compare it with every other element that comes after it in the list (to avoid redundant comparisons).
3. We will calculate the absolute difference between the two elements.
4. If this difference is less than the threshold, we return `True`.
5. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, we return `False`.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list.

Now, let's implement this logic in Python:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    """
    n = len(numbers)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This function will correctly determine if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold.
