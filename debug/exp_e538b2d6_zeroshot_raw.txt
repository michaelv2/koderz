Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Split the sentence into words
2. Check if each word's length is a prime number
3. Keep only words with prime-length
4. Join them back into a sentence

Let me break this down:
- First, I need a helper function to check if a number is prime
- Then iterate through each word, check its length, and keep those with prime lengths
- Finally join the filtered words back into a string

```python
def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n < 2:
            return False
        if n == 2:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return False
        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    words = sentence.split()
    prime_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return " ".join(prime_words)
```
