To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of a triangle given the length of one side (base) and the height corresponding to that base. The formula for the area of a triangle is:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

In this case, the function `triangle_area` takes two parameters: `a` (the length of the side) and `h` (the height). We will use these parameters in the formula to compute the area.

```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 0.5 * a * h
```
