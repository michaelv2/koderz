 The problem can be solved by sorting the list and then alternating between popping elements from the start and end of the sorted list to create the strange order. Here's how we can implement this in Python:

```python
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    lst.sort()  # Sort the list
    result = []  # Initialize an empty list for the result
    while lst:  # While there are elements left in the list
        result.append(lst.pop(0))  # Pop and append the first element
        if lst:  # If there are still elements left
            result.append(lst.pop())  # Pop and append the last element
    return result  # Return the resulting list
```
