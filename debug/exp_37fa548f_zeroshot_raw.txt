```python
def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    # Filter out the strings with odd lengths
    lst = [s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 == 0]
    
    # Sort by length and then alphabetically
    lst.sort()
    lst.sort(key=len)
    
    return lst
```
This function first filters out the strings with odd lengths using a list comprehension, which creates a new list that only contains the strings with even lengths. Then it sorts the list twice: once in alphabetical order and then by length of each word. The sorted list is returned as the result.
