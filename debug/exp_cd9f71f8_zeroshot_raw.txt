Let me reason through this problem:

1. I need to generate the Collatz sequence starting from n
2. Collect only the odd numbers from this sequence
3. Return them as a sorted list

The Collatz sequence rules:
- If n is even: n → n/2
- If n is odd: n → 3n+1
- Continue until reaching 1

For example with n=5:
- 5 (odd) → 3*5+1 = 16
- 16 (even) → 8
- 8 (even) → 4
- 4 (even) → 2
- 2 (even) → 1
- Odd numbers encountered: 5, 1
- Sorted: [1, 5]

```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.
    """
    odd_numbers = []
    
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 1:  # n is odd
            odd_numbers.append(n)
            n = 3 * n + 1
        else:  # n is even
            n = n // 2
    
    # Add 1 as it's always the final odd number in the sequence
    odd_numbers.append(1)
    
    # Return sorted list
    return sorted(odd_numbers)
```
