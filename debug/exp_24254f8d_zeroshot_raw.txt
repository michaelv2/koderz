Let me reason through this problem:

1. I need to extract elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...)
2. Sort those elements
3. Put the sorted elements back into the even indices
4. Keep odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) unchanged

For example, with `[5, 6, 3, 4]`:
- Even indices: 0→5, 2→3 (extract: [5, 3])
- Odd indices: 1→6, 3→4 (keep: [6, 4])
- Sort even values: [3, 5]
- Recombine: [3, 6, 5, 4]

```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal
    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
    [3, 6, 5, 4]
    """
    # Extract elements at even indices
    even_elements = [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 2)]
    
    # Sort them
    even_elements.sort()
    
    # Create result list
    result = l.copy()
    
    # Put sorted even elements back at even indices
    for i, val in enumerate(even_elements):
        result[2 * i] = val
    
    return result
```
