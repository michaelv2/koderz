Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Iterate through the string s
2. Check characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...)
3. Count how many of those characters are uppercase vowels (A, E, I, O, U)

Let me trace through the examples:
- 'aBCdEf': indices 0,2,4 are 'a','C','E' - only 'E' is uppercase vowel at even index → count = 1
- 'abcdefg': indices 0,2,4,6 are 'a','c','e','g' - none are uppercase vowels → count = 0  
- 'dBBE': indices 0,2 are 'd','B' - neither is an uppercase vowel → count = 0

```python
def count_upper(s):
    uppercase_vowels = set('AEIOU')
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):  # iterate through even indices
        if s[i] in uppercase_vowels:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```
