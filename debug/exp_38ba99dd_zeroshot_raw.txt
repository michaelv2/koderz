To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Define the order of planets in the solar system.
2. Validate the input planet names.
3. Determine the indices of the given planets.
4. Extract the planets that lie between these two indices.
5. Return the result as a tuple.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune")
    
    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:
        return ()
    
    index1, index2 = planets.index(planet1), planets.index(planet2)
    
    if index1 > index2:
        index1, index2 = index2, index1
    
    return planets[index1 + 1:index2]
```
