To solve the problem of summing numbers from 1 to n, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of the first n natural numbers is given by:

\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \]

This formula provides a direct way to calculate the sum without needing to iterate through all the numbers, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(1).

Here's how we can implement this in Python:

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n."""
    return n * (n + 1) // 2
```

This implementation uses integer division (`//`) to ensure the result is an integer, which is appropriate since the sum of integers should also be an integer.
