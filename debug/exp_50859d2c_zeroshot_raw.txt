Let me reason through this:

1. I need to determine if `n` is a prime number
2. If `n` is prime, return `x`
3. If `n` is not prime, return `y`

To check if a number is prime:
- Prime numbers are greater than 1
- A prime number has no divisors other than 1 and itself
- I can check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of n

```python
def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    """A simple program which should return the value of x if n is 
    a prime number and should return the value of y otherwise.

    Examples:
    for x_or_y(7, 34, 12) == 34
    for x_or_y(15, 8, 5) == 5
    
    """
    if n < 2:
        return y
    
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return y
    
    return x
```
