To solve this problem, we need to perform two main tasks:
1. Remove all characters from string `s` that are present in string `c`.
2. Check if the resulting string is a palindrome.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
- Iterate through each character in `s` and construct a new string by including only those characters not present in `c`.
- Check if the constructed string reads the same forwards and backwards to determine if it is a palindrome.
- Return a tuple containing the resulting string and a boolean indicating whether it is a palindrome.

```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    # Create a set of characters to delete for faster lookup
    chars_to_delete = set(c)
    
    # Construct the result string by excluding characters in chars_to_delete
    result_string = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in chars_to_delete)
    
    # Check if the result string is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = result_string == result_string[::-1]
    
    # Return the result as a tuple
    return (result_string, is_palindrome)
```
