Let me think through this problem:

1. I need to count distinct characters in a string, ignoring case (uppercase and lowercase are treated as the same)
2. For 'xyzXYZ': converting to lowercase gives 'xyzxyz', which has 3 distinct characters (x, y, z)
3. For 'Jerry': converting to lowercase gives 'jerry', which has 4 distinct characters (j, e, r, y)

The approach is simple:
- Convert the string to lowercase
- Use a set to get unique characters
- Return the length of the set

```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of
    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
    3
    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
    4
    """
    return len(set(string.lower()))
```
