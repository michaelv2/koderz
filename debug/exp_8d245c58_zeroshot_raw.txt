Looking at this problem, I need to determine if a given integer is a perfect cube.

My approach:
1. Handle the special case of 0 (which is 0³)
2. For positive numbers, I can take the cube root and check if it's an integer
3. For negative numbers, I can take the absolute value, find the cube root, then check if it's an integer, and return True since negative numbers can be cubes of negative integers
4. I need to be careful with floating point precision when taking cube roots

Let me think about the implementation:
- For a positive number a, if there exists an integer n such that n³ = a, then a is a perfect cube
- I can compute the cube root using a**(1/3) and check if it's close to an integer
- For negative numbers, I can work with the absolute value and then check if the result is negative

```python
def iscube(a):
    if a == 0:
        return True
    
    # Handle negative numbers
    if a < 0:
        # For negative numbers, check if the absolute value is a perfect cube
        # and return True since negative numbers can be cubes of negative integers
        abs_a = -a
        cube_root = round(abs_a ** (1/3))
        return cube_root ** 3 == abs_a
    
    # Handle positive numbers
    cube_root = round(a ** (1/3))
    return cube_root ** 3 == a
```
