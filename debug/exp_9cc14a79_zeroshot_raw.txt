To solve the problem of inserting a delimiter between every two consecutive elements of a list, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the result.
2. Iterate through the input list `numbers`.
3. For each element in the list, append it to the result list.
4. If the current element is not the last one in the list, append the delimiter to the result list.
5. Return the result list.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Insert a number 'delimiter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers' """
    result = []
    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        result.append(num)
        if i < len(numbers) - 1:
            result.append(delimiter)
    return result
```
