To solve this problem, we need to generate all possible prefixes of a given string, starting from the shortest prefix (the first character) to the longest prefix (the entire string). 

Here's a step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the prefixes.
2. Iterate over the string using a loop where the index `i` ranges from 0 to the length of the string minus one.
3. In each iteration, take the substring from the start of the string up to the current index `i+1` and append it to the list of prefixes.
4. Return the list of prefixes after the loop completes.

This approach ensures that we capture all prefixes in order from shortest to longest.

```python
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string """
    prefixes = []
    for i in range(len(string)):
        prefixes.append(string[:i+1])
    return prefixes
```
