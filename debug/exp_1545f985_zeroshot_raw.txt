Let me reason through this problem:

1. I need to find the word with the maximum number of unique characters
2. If there's a tie (multiple words with the same max number of unique characters), return the one that comes first lexicographically
3. The number of unique characters can be found using `set(word)`

My approach:
- For each word, count the number of unique characters using `len(set(word))`
- Track the word with the maximum unique character count
- If a word has the same number of unique characters as the current max, compare lexicographically and keep the one that comes first

```python
def find_max(words):
    if not words:
        return ""
    
    max_word = words[0]
    max_unique = len(set(words[0]))
    
    for word in words[1:]:
        unique_count = len(set(word))
        if unique_count > max_unique:
            max_word = word
            max_unique = unique_count
        elif unique_count == max_unique and word < max_word:
            max_word = word
    
    return max_word
```
