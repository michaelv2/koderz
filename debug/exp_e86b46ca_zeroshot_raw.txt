Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Calculate the sum of all digits in the integer N
2. Convert that sum to binary representation
3. Return the binary representation as a string

Let me trace through the examples:
- N = 1000: digits are 1,0,0,0 → sum = 1 → binary = "1"
- N = 150: digits are 1,5,0 → sum = 6 → binary = "110" 
- N = 147: digits are 1,4,7 → sum = 12 → binary = "1100"

My approach:
1. Convert N to string to easily access individual digits
2. Sum all the digits
3. Convert the sum to binary using bin() and remove the '0b' prefix

```python
def solve(N):
    # Calculate sum of digits
    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(N))
    
    # Convert sum to binary and remove '0b' prefix
    binary_result = bin(digit_sum)[2:]
    
    return binary_result
```
